    <p>Season 4 of the show was the worst season so far. Can the final season rebound and end the show on a high note? Stay tuned to find out.</p>
<p>Bob Richardson directed all episodes.</p>
<div class="section" id="the-wedding">
<h2><strong>The Wedding</strong></h2>
<img alt="Shot from the first episode of the fifth season of the Spider-Man 1994 television series." class="align-center" src="images/16-01-S05E01-wedding.png" />
<p class="center"><em>&quot;I object to this marriage.&quot; - Green Goblin</em></p>
<p><strong>Story by</strong>: John Semper.</p>
<p><strong>Teleplay by</strong>: John Semper and Meg McLaughlin.</p>
<p>Mary Jane Watson and Peter Parker are ready to tie the knot, but there are major obstacles to be faced before and during the cerimony. The season starts off in strong fashion, with a dynamic and interesting storyline with the Green Goblin returning to make sure the wedding does not go as planned. My favorite part was both Jameson and the Kingpin trying to get one over the other to see who can better help at the wedding, a funny dynamic that added a lot. The Green Goblin returning is always welcoming and see Harry getting better at the end thanks to Liz is a good way to finish the character's arc. The final season finishes up one of the previous season main storylines to kick us off. Let's hope the momentum can be maintained.</p>

<h2><strong>Six Forgotten Warriors: Chapter I</strong></h2>
<img alt="Shot from the second episode of the fifth season of the Spider-Man 1994 television series." class="align-center" src="images/16-02-S05E02-warriors.png" />
<p class="center"><em>&quot;You must stop May Parker.&quot; - Nick Fury</em></p>
<p><strong>Written by</strong>: John Semper.</p>
<p>Now, let's add a little bit of the Cold War to the show. Peter Parker's parents as Russian spies? Worked for me, I guess. While this storyline is a little bit out there, the execution of this first part really sets the stage well. The Sinister Six is back thanks to the Kingpin, Parker convinces Jameson to go to Russia in the funniest way possible and May Parker is a global threat. So much happens in this episode that makes me excited to see long-term storytelling once again. The action scenes are well made and now we will uncover a mystery our protagonist's parents. All of this in Russia. Seems like the show is back on form with a spy novel thriller being developed.</p>

<h2><strong>Unclaimed Legacy</strong></h2>
<img alt="Shot from the third episode of the fifth season of the Spider-Man 1994 television series." class="align-center" src="images/16-03-S05E03-legacy.png" />
<p class="center"><em>&quot;World domination? Kingpin, now you sound like a Saturday morning cartoon villain.&quot; - Spider-Man</em></p>
<p><strong>Written by</strong>: John Semper.</p>
<p>Our hero heads to Moscow and all the trouble possible follows him there. Kingpin wants the Doomsday Device and has the Sinister Six to help, and this time they are on the same page. Red Skull almost shows up, but it is his son at this moment. The plot thickens and anticipation begins to mount regarding when Red Skull will show up and what kind of threat will he bring. There was a lot of action and fighting here, with the new surroundings doing the show a breath of fresh air. A good follow-up that did not advance that much of the story, but still brought good action and a resolution to the spy story where we discover that Peter's parents were not spies.</p>

<div class="section" id="secrets-of-the-six">
<h2><strong>Secrets of the Six</strong></h2>
<img alt="Shot from the fourth episode of the fifth season of the Spider-Man 1994 television series." class="align-center" src="images/16-04-S05E04-secrets.png" />
<p class="center"><em>&quot;Miss America? The Thunderer? With those names, they expected to be taken seriously?&quot; - Peter Parker</em></p>
<p><strong>Written by</strong>: John Semper.</p>
<p>The world's tackiest super heroes are revealed. The Six Forgotten Warriors backstory is an interesting one, but the characters themselves are tacky, no doubt about it. We spend ten minutes of the episode learning about these new characters and how Captain America fought Red Skull during World War II, really expanding the show's universe with this decision. I find it interesting how the Insidious Six are being used in this arc, being the muscle to go after the Six Forgotten Warriors. Matching the heroes and villains in groups of six creates good action scenes between the thugs and the old school heroes. From a deeper point of view, the final reflection that Peter has regarding where his life will end up is one of the coolest reflections from the show. While not a top tier story from the show, the arc is a return to form to the show and I am excited for its continuation.</p>

<div class="section" id="the-six-fight-again">
<h2><strong>The Six Fight Again</strong></h2>
<img alt="Shot from the fifth episode of the fifth season of the Spider-Man 1994 television series." class="align-center" src="images/16-05-S05E05-six.png" />
<p class="center"><em>&quot;Nice catch! Did you ever think of trying out for the Yankees&quot; - Spider-Man</em></p>
<p><strong>Written by</strong>: John Semper.</p>
<p>The Six American Warriors. The Insidious Six. Red Skull's family. Spider-Man. God knows who else. We approach the end of the arc in explosive fashion, with Kingpin finally getting the six statues together and Red Skull coming back. It is always great when the show can put all of the characters interacting together in well-made fight scenes. Even with a lot of people, these episodes do not look bloated since everyone has a part to play. Captain America returning as well is a lot of fun. Everytime someone thinks they have the upper hand, a new development happens and the tension mounts again, which is awesome. The Cold War climate and espionage atmosphere is doing wonders for this arc, so expectations are high for the resolution in the next episode.</p>
