:summary: After graduating from college, I became an Amazonian. Let's talk a little bit about this process and this awesome beginning. This post was written to the sound of the `soundtrack from Top Gun`_. You can listen one of the songs here_.

Wow.

What a ride the last few months have been.

As you may already figured out, I got hired by Amazon after graduating from college.

To be more specific, I'm currently part of Amazon Web Services (AWS).

To be even more specific, I'm a part of AWS Tech U Program, a special program for new graduates to train them to become Solutions Architects. I got the opportunity to move from my hometown, Natal, to Latin America's biggest city - in terms of population, Sao Paulo. It was a brilliant recruitment experience and an amazing onboarding process at AWS.

But, then, the world stopped.

COVID-19 happened.

I actually spent just one week on-premises before AWS decided that I could work from home during the pandemic. I didn't even setup my workspace properly. There's probably an unplugged HDMI cable hanging out at my desk as you're reading this.

I'm not going to dwell much about the situation since everybody is living it, but I would like to point it out how grateful - some might say even lucky - I am right now to have started my career here. The carnage from the pandemic can not be understated. I got relatives and friends that lost jobs as soon as the quarantines started. Of course, as almost everyone on planet Earth right now, I'm a little bit anxious about my future, but so far I'm grateful that the effects haven't affected the program - even though anything can happen. The only thing I can do is work hard and be mindful about my health and the health of everyone around me.

Actually, that's not the only thing I can do. I can watch Married... with Children. I'm currently on season 3. Jim Halpert may have to watch out, Al Bundy is making a big case to be my new favorite TV character.

Anyways, I hope that everything comes back to normal as soon as possible. COVID-19 looks like my generation's defining moment... and I'm sure we will overcome it.
