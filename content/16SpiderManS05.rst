:summary: After four years of alternating between writing and procrastination, my **Spider-Man:TAS** project has come to an end. I am already crying. This post was written to the sound of The Cars' `Heartbeat City`_. You can listen one of the songs here_.

Season 4 of the show was the worst season so far. Can the final season rebound and end the show on a high note? Stay tuned to find out.

Bob Richardson directed all episodes.

*"I object to this marriage." - Green Goblin*

**Story by**: John Semper.

**Teleplay by**: John Semper and Meg McLaughlin.

Mary Jane Watson and Peter Parker are ready to tie the knot, but there are major obstacles to be faced before and during the cerimony. The season starts off in strong fashion, with a dynamic and interesting storyline with the Green Goblin returning to make sure the wedding does not go as planned. My favorite part was both Jameson and the Kingpin trying to get one over the other to see who can better help at the wedding, a funny dynamic that added a lot. The Green Goblin returning is always welcoming and see Harry getting better at the end thanks to Liz is a good way to finish the character's arc. The final season finishes up one of the previous season main storylines to kick us off. Let's hope the momentum can be maintained.

**Six Forgotten Warriorrs: Chapter I**

*"You must stop May Parker." - Nick Fury*

**Written by**: John Semper.

Now, let's add a little bit of the Cold War to the show. Peter Parker's parents as Russian spies? Worked for me, I guess. While this storyline is a little bit out there, the execution of this first part really sets the stage well. The Sinister Six is back thanks to the Kingpin, Parker convinces Jameson to go to Russia in the funniest way possible and May Parker is a global threat. So much happens in this episode that makes me excited to see long-term storytelling once again. The action scenes are well made and now we will uncover a mystery our protagonist's parents. All of this in Russia. Seems like the show is back on form with a spy novel thriller being developed.
