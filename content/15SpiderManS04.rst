:summary: Once again, we're back. I'll finish these reviews of the show until the end of 2025. I promise. This post was written to the sound of Alt J's `An Awesome Wave`_. You can listen one of the songs here_.

After the best episode of the series, Season 4 of **Spider-Man: TAS** has high expectations. Can the show keep the momentum? Let's find out.

*"I hope you'll change your mind about taking pictures of Spider-Man, Peter. I've never been more convinced in my life that Spider-Man is a true hero. I know his job's not easy, but he's exactly what this city, this world, needs right now. I hope he never gives up." - Joseph Robertson*

**Story:** John Semper.

Guilt is a strong sentiment that drives Spider-Man for most of the premiere. Flashbacks from the previous Season Finale start us this season and what follows is a conflicted Spider-Man that thinks that his antics do more harm than good. We went in this place before in the series, but this time the stakes are higher since we are talking about the disappearance of Mary Jane. To surpass this, a small redemption story is a good starting point. Kingpin sets up Robbie and Spider-Man partners with "Jigsaw" Jameson to save him. The dynamic between the journalist and the hero here is great, generating some laughs along the way. While the episode is nice, it also feels like we already have this discussion about how Spider-Man does good to the world before in the series, so I believe that not much was added to the topic here. A solid start to the season to get us started.
