:summary: Once again, we're back. I'll finish these reviews of the show until the end of 2025. I promise. This post was written to the sound of Alt J's `An Awesome Wave`_. You can listen one of the songs here_.

After the best episode of the series, Season 4 of **Spider-Man: TAS** has high expectations. Can the show keep the momentum? Let's find out.

Bob Richardson directed all episodes.

**Guilty**

*"I hope you'll change your mind about taking pictures of Spider-Man, Peter. I've never been more convinced in my life that Spider-Man is a true hero. I know his job's not easy, but he's exactly what this city, this world, needs right now. I hope he never gives up." - Joseph Robertson*

**Story by**: John Semper.

**Teleplay by:** Larry Brody and Meg McLaughlin.

Guilt is a strong sentiment that drives Spider-Man for most of the premiere. Flashbacks from the previous Season Finale start us this season and what follows is a conflicted Spider-Man that thinks that his antics do more harm than good. We went in this place before in the series, but this time the stakes are higher since we are talking about the disappearance of Mary Jane. To surpass this, a small redemption story is a good starting point. Kingpin sets up Robbie and Spider-Man partners with "Jigsaw" Jameson to save him. The dynamic between the journalist and the hero here is great, generating some laughs along the way. While the episode is nice, it also feels like we already have this discussion about how Spider-Man does good to the world before in the series, so I believe that not much was added to the topic here. A solid start to the season to get us started.

**The Cat**

*"Why do I always fall for mysterious men? Jason, Michael, Spider-Man. Men who are wrapped in the dark blanket of the night." - Felicia Hardy*

**Story by**: John Semper.

**Teleplay by**: Sean Catherine Derek.

Felicia Hardy was always an interesting presence throughout the series, but it is about to receive a new spotlight as the Black Cat. This episode starts this, with her family once again in trouble. The way the writing combines a Kingpin plot with Captain America's origin and the Hardy family is really well done and a clever connection between stories. I am excited to have this new approach on the character and this kickoff of the plot shows how the show can take a side character and make a interesting storyline with deep connections to well-known comic book arcs. The lowlight here was Dr. Octopus just being a hired gun for the Kingpin, even though we know that the character can be much more.

**The Black Cat**

*"Ever hear the phrase, divide and conquer?" - Black Cat*

**Story by**: John Semper.

**Teleplay by**: Marty Isenberg, Robert N. Skir, and Sean Catherine Derek.

The Black Cat is now officially with us. Kingpin develops the serum to create the Super Soldiers and applies it on Felicia Hardy. In this beginning, Spider-Man has great chemistry with her. The initial scene between them has great lines and tension that resonates through the rest of the episode. One of the best aspects of this relationship is that the Black Cat respected Spider-Man's identity and he does not know who she is, which makes the partnership more fun. Overall, Kingpin's plan to create super criminals is a little stupid and one of the instances where his idea makes little sense and is needed only to advance the plot. Even with a soft story, the moments between the main characters and the Hardy family more than make things up.

**The Return of Kraven**

*"There's nothing that beast can dish out that this beauty can't handle." - Black Cat*

**Written by**: Meg McLaughlin.

A good story needs a good villain. While the addition of the Black Cat is adding a lot to the show, Kraven returning does not do much for me. The best part of this episode is Spider-Man turning away the Black Cat for fear of hurting someone once again. Our hero turns to bitterness in multiple points of the episode while trying to understand why Kraven is back. The plot involving the Hunter is not that interesting, but the character moments from all characters here makes up for it. The ending is also an interesting part, with Peter moving in with Harry even after their issues throughout the last season. An enjoyable - even though forgettable - installment of the show.

**Partners**

*"Maybe I should take superhero lessons from the Hulk instead." - Black Cat*

**Story by**: John Semper.

**Teleplay by**: Cynthia Harrison and Brooks Wachtel.

The fourth season of **Spider-Man: TAS** relies a lot on the dynamic between Spider-Man and the Black Cat, positioning her as a main recurrent character in a way we did not see before in the series. Even so, we arrive at the fifth episode of the season without a major storyline itself besides the relationship between them. This results in episodes such as **Partners**, where the stakes are not that high, but the show still keeps delivering enjoyable adventures. This time, the cast of the episode involves a lot of villains, but the highlight goes to the Scorpion, one of the best characters of the show. Here, he fights to cure himself from his disease to get married. He is unable to do so, but the way the writing puts him going from hero to villain to hero multiple times in the episode itself humanizes our green friend.
