*"You should take that act to Vegas. All he needs is a couple of tigers." - Spider-Man*

**Written by:** John Semper and Mark Hoffmeier.

Family is a fundamental aspect of any iteration of the Spider-Man story and the season premiere of the third season brings this to the forefront. Mary Jane is kidnapped and Spider-Man is looking for her. After a season of sci-fi horror, we encounter the magic world of Doctor Strange, Wong, Baron Mordo, and Dormammu. This was a great change of pace for the series, an episode where Spider-Man's powers were pretty uneffective in combat. Mary Jane that assumes the protagonism here, dealing with her abusive father's past and being brainwashed because of that. It was a great character arc for Mary Jane to overcome by herself the mind control and break free of her past. This allowed her to be a protagonist and not just a damsel in distress. The episode also introduces Doctor Strange in great fashion, telling us about its story with Mordo through quick and productive flashbacks. The character added a lot to the episode, with Spider-Man's reactions to the world of magic being the humorous highlight here.

**Make a Wish**

*"I am not your enemy, Peter Parker. You are." - Madame Web*

**Story by**: John Semper.

**Teleplay by**: Mark Hoffmeier, Elliot S. Maggin, and Meg McLaughlin.

*Make a Wish* is a brilliant episode. It combines three of the best stories from Spider-Man into one and delivers the content in unforgettable fashion. We see Peter Parker giving up on being Spider-Man ("Spider-Man No More!"), Madame Web making her presence known and showing how important of a character it will be, the hero's origin story and a recollection of the classic `The Kid Who Collects Spider-Man`_. This combination shows a powerful story where we are reminded that Peter Parker has personal misfortunes amid his heroism. It just shows that his struggles will never be over as long as he embraces his responsibilities. The only negative here for me are the dream sequences in the origin story. I was never a fan of the dream sequences and Peter showing up as an actual spider is more gross than entertaining. But even with that, this episode still ranks highly on my list of favorite episodes of the series. The story, the chemistry with Taina, Madame Web confronting Peter, Doctor Octopus gaining the upperhand and outsmarting the hero... Everything positive meshes so well that brings the episode into a different bracket of great episodes.
