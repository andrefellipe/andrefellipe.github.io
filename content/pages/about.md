## Who I am

Hello, I'm Andre and I'm a Solutions Architect at AWS. I act as a trusted advisor for enterprise customers that want flexible and resilient cloud-based solutions.

I'm also a B. Eng. from the Federal University of Rio Grande do Norte, Brazil.

Furthermore, I like to write on andrefellipe.com and my all-time favorite TV character is Jim Halpert from The Office.

"So this is my life. Until I win the lottery."

## About this website

I've created this site to show my personal projects, to talk about my interests, to practice my writing skills in english and to complain if my football team loses.
