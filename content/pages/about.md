## Who I am

Hello, I'm Andre and I'm a Solutions Architect at AWS. I act as a trusted advisor for enterprise customers that want flexible and resilient cloud-based solutions.

I'm also a B. Eng. from the Federal University of Rio Grande do Norte, Brazil.

Before becoming an Amazonian, I've worked for almost one year as a developer in projects using different types of technologies, such as Java, Android, Python, PHP, SQL and front-end ones like HTML, CSS and JavaScript. You can check out some of my code at github.com/andrefellipe.

Thanks to my versatility, I have one year of professional experience in budgeting electrical engineering projects and project management, specially related to structured cabling, substation grounding and soil resistivity. Because of this, I'm proficient with AutoCAD and Microsoft Excel.

Furthermore, I like to participate in data science competitions, write on andrefellipe.com and my all-time favorite TV character is Jim Halpert from The Office.

"So this is my life. Until I win the lottery."

## About this website

I've created this site to show my personal projects, to talk about my interests, to practice my writing skills in english and to complain if my football team loses.
