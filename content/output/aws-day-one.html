    <p>Wow.</p>
<p>What a ride the last few months have been.</p>
<p>As you may already figured out, I got hired by Amazon after graduating from college.</p>
<p>To be more specific, I'm currently part of Amazon Web Services (AWS).</p>
<p>To be even more specific, I'm a part of AWS Tech U Program, a special program for new graduates to train them to become Solutions Architects. I got the opportunity to move from my hometown, Natal, to Latin America's biggest city - in terms of population, Sao Paulo. It was a brilliant recruitment experience and an amazing onboarding process at AWS.</p>
<p>But, then, the world stopped.</p>
<p>COVID-19 happened.</p>
<p>I actually spent just one week on-premises before AWS decided that I could work from home during the pandemic. I didn't even setup my workspace properly. There's probably an unplugged HDMI cable hanging out at my desk as you're reading this.</p>
<p>I'm not going to dwell much about the situation since everybody is living it, but I would like to point it out how grateful - some might say even lucky - I am right now to have started my career here. The carnage from the pandemic can not be understated. I got relatives and friends that lost jobs as soon as the quarantines started. Of course, as almost everyone on planet Earth right now, I'm a little bit anxious about my future, but so far I'm grateful that the effects haven't affected the program - even though anything can happen. The only thing I can do is work hard and be mindful about my health and the health of everyone around me.</p>
<p>Actually, that's not the only thing I can do. I can watch Married... with Children. I'm currently on season 3. Jim Halpert may have to watch out, Al Bundy is making a big case to be my new favorite TV character.</p>
<p>Anyways, I hope that everything comes back to normal as soon as possible. COVID-19 looks like my generation's defining moment... and I'm sure we will overcome it.</p>
