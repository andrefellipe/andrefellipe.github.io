&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Written by:&lt;/strong&gt; John Semper and Mark Hoffmeier.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Family is a fundamental aspect of any iteration of the Spider-Man story and the season premiere of the third season brings this to the forefront. Mary Jane is kidnapped and Spider-Man is looking for her. After a season of sci-fi horror, we encounter the magic world of Doctor Strange, Wong, Baron Mordo, and Dormammu. This was a great change of pace for the series, an episode where Spider-Man's powers were pretty uneffective in combat. Mary Jane that assumes the protagonism here, dealing with her abusive father's past and being brainwashed because of that. It was a great character arc for Mary Jane to overcome by herself the mind control and break free of her past. This allowed her to be a protagonist and not just a damsel in distress. The episode also introduces Doctor Strange in great fashion, telling us about its story with Mordo through quick and productive flashbacks. The character added a lot to the episode, with Spider-Man's reactions to the world of magic being the humorous highlight here.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The Insidious Six&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;img alt="Shot from the first episode of the second season of the Spider-Man 1994 television series." class="align-center" src="images/13-01-S02E01-six.png" /&gt;
&lt;p class="center"&gt;&lt;em&gt;&amp;quot;I go to sleep one lousy day and I wake up in The Twilight Zone.&amp;quot; - Spider-Man&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Written by:&lt;/strong&gt; John Semper and David Lee Miller.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The second season of &lt;strong&gt;Spider-Man: TAS&lt;/strong&gt; starts with one of the most famous Spider-Man stories: The Insidious Six. In this version, Kingpin frees Rhino, Shocker, Doctor Octopus, Mysterio, Scorpion, and Chameleon to take down our hero. Meanwhile, Spider-Man starts to lose its powers in the most unfortunate times. The episode does a good job on playing up the tension between the villains, with Doctor Octopus being reluctant to join forces with them because its own scientific adventures and the conflicts between themselves to see who gets to eliminate Spider-Man. The combination of both storylines - the supergroup villains and Spider-Man without superpowers - creates a positive dynamic, with the hero having to scape on foot and changing it to Peter Parker to avoid disaster. The usage of Aunt May to attract Peter to a trap without its powers leaves us with a tense cliffhanger for the second part. This is a strong start to the season even though it leaves use with a feeling of not much new things happening since Spider-Man is facing previous enemies that we already saw last season.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;New characters such as Michael Morbius and Silvermane are introduced in small bits. Considering how well the series plays with storytelling, I am certain that this is not the last time we will see them this season.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="section" id="battle-of-the-insidious-six"&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Battle of the Insidious Six&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;img alt="Shot from the second episode of the second season of the Spider-Man 1994 television series." class="align-center" src="images/13-02-S02E02-six-battle.png" /&gt;
&lt;p class="center"&gt;&lt;em&gt;&amp;quot;I'll hit them first.&amp;quot; - Kingpin&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Story by&lt;/strong&gt;: John Semper.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Teleplay by&lt;/strong&gt;: Doug Booth.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The second part of the Insidious Six storylines delivers after the good setup in the first part. The most interesting dynamic here is having Spider-Man save Silvermane without knowing anything about the villain and the crossfire between the crime lords while fighting Kingpin's faction. Silvermane is no match for Kingpin when it comes to being a worthy foe for Spider-Man, but the character here serves its purpose, even though why Kingpin should be intimidated by him is not clear. The narrative plays into the &amp;quot;Spider-Man without powers is easy pickins&amp;quot; heavily. The best bits of the episode comes when Spider-Man does not have superpowers and has to rely on Peter's intelligence - and the villains' lack of it - to survive multiple onslaughts. Spider-Man outsmarting six of its main foes at the same time is too good of a premise for anyone to mess it up and the writers deliver once more in this solid start to the season. It's Spider-Man at his best and a delight for us to see.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="section" id="hydro-man"&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Hydro-Man&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;img alt="Shot from the third episode of the second season of the Spider-Man 1994 television series." class="align-center" src="images/13-03-S02E03-hydro-man.png" /&gt;
&lt;p class="center"&gt;&lt;em&gt;&amp;quot;I can give you everything you've ever dreamed of.&amp;quot; - Hydro-Man&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Story by&lt;/strong&gt;: John Semper.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Teleplay by&lt;/strong&gt;: James Krieg.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is the first episode where Spider-Man is only here for the action since the writers decided to give the spotlight for Mary Jane. While our hero is preoccupied with its mutation, Mary Jane receives a unexpected visit from her ex-boyfriend, Morris &amp;quot;Morrie&amp;quot; Bench, who now has superpowers and commits a series of robberies to have money and win her back. The main purpose of the episode is to give more backstory to the Mary Jane character, specially considering that we only know her through the eyes of Peter Parker. While her ex-boyfriend and father storyline is abrupt, I believe that it is because the show until now did not present any story with a similar tone as this one. &lt;strong&gt;Spider-Man: TAS&lt;/strong&gt; focus on Peter Parker, its dramas and its villains with the rest playing it a low-key role in everything. This is the first time the show dedicates so much time to another character and this decision pays off for the future of the series, even though Hydro-Man is too stereotypical here as the bully former boyfriend to be that interesting as a foe. Spider-Man was not even needed to beat him. While not perfect, this was a valid effort to change the scenery for once, with Peter and Mary Jane finally kissing for the first time at the end.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="section" id="the-mutant-agenda"&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The Mutant Agenda&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;img alt="Shot from the fourth episode of the second season of the Spider-Man 1994 television series." class="align-center" src="images/13-04-S02E04-mutant.png" /&gt;
&lt;p class="center"&gt;&lt;em&gt;&amp;quot;But I don't want to be a freak.&amp;quot; - Spider-Man&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Story by&lt;/strong&gt;: John Semper, J. M. DeMatteis and Stevent Grant.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Teleplay by&lt;/strong&gt;: Michael Edens.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now the season raises the stakes. &lt;strong&gt;The Mutant Agenda&lt;/strong&gt; brings the X-Men and allows the show to take its most bold universe expansion so far, crossing over the mutants with a conflicted Spider-Man. While the previous episodes gave glimpses on our hero psyche dealing with its continuous mutation, the fourth episode of the season dives deep on this, with Spider-Man rebuffing the X-Men and isolating himself in searching for a cure. Its Spider-Man at its most serious ever since the Venom storyline and the writers always know how to hit the right points to increase the paranoia, showing the hero's fear of becoming something not human. The X-Men universe blends well with all of this, with the introduction of Herbert Landon, its devious plan and the return of the Hobgoblin sounding natural. The episode introduces and brings back elements of the show with ease, resulting in a crossover fight between Spider-Man and Wolverine that was brewing since the first minute. An excellent episode that pushes the season in a darker direction.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="section" id="mutants-revenge"&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Mutants' Revenge&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;img alt="Shot from the fifth episode of the second season of the Spider-Man 1994 television series." class="align-center" src="images/13-05-S02E05-revenge.png" /&gt;
&lt;p class="center"&gt;&lt;em&gt;&amp;quot;I had to be reminded that when I'm in trouble I'm not alone. I need to turn to my friends.&amp;quot; - Spider-Man&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Story by&lt;/strong&gt;: John Semper and Michael Edens.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Teleplay by&lt;/strong&gt;: Francis Moss and Ted Pedersen.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Spider-Man is a lonely hero. While he has partners that can help him when a dangerous situation arise, he must hide its identity to protect the people close to him. His financial situation is not the best. He has to deal the death of Uncle Ben in his mind. He is not a part of a superhero team. Peter Parker carries the weight of the world in his shoulders and that's why we love him so much. &lt;strong&gt;Mutants' Revenge&lt;/strong&gt; reminds our hero that he can get help from his friends when the going gets tough. In the episode, Spider-Man has to make amends with the X-Men to beat Herbert Landon and the Hobgoblin and finds a possible path to cure its mutation. The way the episode starts with a fight with Wolverine and ends with a green monster while also putting the Hobgoblin in the mix is quite fun and guarantees the action throughout the twenty minutes. Also, the banter with Wolverine goes as well as one can expect. Our heros band together to beat the villain, New York survives once again. Even with this, the final moment is the show in one of its most poignant moments so far: why Spider-Man took so long to go for a friend's help? Why does he have to deal with all that is going on his mind alone? Maybe he has not. That's what this episode is all about. Let's see if it worked in the next one.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="section" id="morbius"&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Morbius&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;img alt="Shot from the sixth episode of the second season of the Spider-Man 1994 television series." class="align-center" src="images/13-06-S02E06-morbius.png" /&gt;
&lt;p class="center"&gt;&lt;em&gt;&amp;quot;I need more plasma.&amp;quot; - Michael Morbius&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Story by&lt;/strong&gt;: John Semper.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Teleplay by&lt;/strong&gt;: Brynne Stephens and Lydia Marano.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Well, it did not. &lt;strong&gt;Morbius&lt;/strong&gt; becomes a vampire-like creature after messing with Spider-Man's blood and the neogenic recombinator. This leaves Spider-Man wondering why everything related to him is poison to his closest people, triggering him to drink the serum that Dr. Crawford made. Then the mutation on his body accelerates instead of curing him. Voilá, we have Peter Parker with four extra arms and my childhood was ruined as soon as I finished this episode. This is a another great installment of the season, transforming Michael Morbius from creepy guy to a tragic figure in love with Felicia Hardy. The amount of tragedies in the second year of the show keeps increasing and it's interesting how the writers can introduce a character like Morbius in a subtle way and a couple of episodes later transform him in one of the series most compelling characters. It's interesting how the good the fight scenes here are, the first with a couple of common robbers almost taking Spider-Man out in a funny bit and the one with Morbius showing our hero not even fighting him, but trying to save him. Considering where we were in the sixth episode of the light-hearted first season, we can see here how much the show has already matured.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="section" id="enter-the-punisher"&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Enter the Punisher&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;img alt="Shot from the seventh episode of the second season of the Spider-Man 1994 television series." class="align-center" src="images/13-07-S02E07-punisher.png" /&gt;
&lt;p class="center"&gt;&lt;em&gt;&amp;quot;Let's just say that you don't own the franchise on weirdness.&amp;quot; - Spider-Man&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Written by&lt;/strong&gt;: John Semper and Carl Potts.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The hunt is on. Punisher shows up to get Spider-Man thinking the six-arms wall crawler kidnapped Morbius. The introduction of the character does seem out of the blue at the start, but enough context is given for us to move forward. This is the episode where Spider-Man mutates into Man-Spider during its fight with Punisher as the cliffhanger. Meanwhile, Morbius is still hungry for plasma. Mary Jane is angry at Peter for not accepting a date with her. A lot of moving parts here. The episode has a great ending, but, overall, it is uneven because the Punisher sounds too much like generical tough guy here. The way the character is presented and its motivation to take out Spider-Man are not convincing, even though the action is good. The episode hits the necessary notes to advance the story and Spider-Man with six arms and as Man-Spider are nice visuals, but after the previous episodes, this was a downgrade.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="section" id="duel-of-the-hunters"&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Duel of the Hunters&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;img alt="Shot from the eight episode of the second season of the Spider-Man 1994 television series." class="align-center" src="images/13-08-S02E08-hunters.png" /&gt;
&lt;p class="center"&gt;&lt;em&gt;&amp;quot;I looked at the devil square in the eyes... And I blinked.&amp;quot; - The Punisher&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Written by&lt;/strong&gt;: John Semper.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Man-Spider storyline reaches a conclusion in explosive fashion, with all the different players involved - Man-Spider, Morbius, Kraven, and Punisher - battling it out in some shape or form during the twenty minutes. It's interesting how the writers combine two characters that were not interesting at first - Punisher and Kraven - and create a positive dynamic with them. This happens because this episode focus on the human side of them instead of the stereotypical characterization that both of them had in previous installments of the series. This is the episode where Spider-Man has almost no dialogue because the of the Man-Spider mutation, so other characters have a better chance to shine. It's one of the best episodes of the season with a powerful message. Monsters sometimes are true victims and we should not give up on people because of our previous experiences.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="section" id="blade-the-vampire-hunter"&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Blade, the Vampire Hunter&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;img alt="Shot from the ninth episode of the second season of the Spider-Man 1994 television series." class="align-center" src="images/13-09-S02E09-blade.png" /&gt;
&lt;p class="center"&gt;&lt;em&gt;&amp;quot;Is there a vampire convention in town?&amp;quot; - Spider-Man&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Written by&lt;/strong&gt;: Stephanie Mathison, Mark Hoffmeier and John Semper.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Another new player shows up in New York: Blade. And he wants Morbius dead. It's interesting how the show introduces Blade in a much better way than the Punisher, giving the character a proper backstory in his first appearance and explaining his hatred for vampires. This propels a interesting episode where he wants to kill Morbius while Spider-Man wants to save him. In the meantime, Morbius learns how to love its powers and wants to transform everyone in vampires, a rehash of the Lizard story that we saw in the first episode of the series. The fight scenes and the mythology involving vampires expands even more of the already rich universe of the show. What makes this episode good, though, is one of Spider-Man recurrent themes: how he still tries to save the world around him while everyone dislikes his guts, as seen here with the police and the people of New York thinking he is the villain. This is always a good plot device and it plays well here. Another important point is how much of the season is composed of Spider-Man teaming with other people to achieve something, as seen here with Blade. Another hunt is on. This time for Morbius.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="section" id="the-immortal-vampire"&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The Immortal Vampire&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;img alt="Shot from the tenth episode of the second season of the Spider-Man 1994 television series." class="align-center" src="images/13-10-S02E10-vampire.png" /&gt;
&lt;p class="center"&gt;&lt;em&gt;&amp;quot;What is running in your veins? Ice water?&amp;quot; - Terri Lee&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Written by&lt;/strong&gt;: John Semper and Meg McLaughlin.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Morbius storyline reaches its conclusion without much conclusion. He kidnaps Aunt May to use as leverage to get Peter to collaborate with him. This triggers an angry Spider-Man that has to rescue her while trying to save Morbius. Meanwhile, Blade and Detective Terri Lee fall in love. This is an episode where a lot of things happen, but they do not have a clear-cut sense of finality, a novel concept for the show. Morbius mutates further into a bat and flies away, Blade goes as well and Peter is relieved since Aunt May is not hurt. Also, Mary Jane finally has enough of him and chooses Harry Osborn. My biggest disappointment with this episode is that it appears to leverage the &lt;a class="reference external" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/If_This_Be_My_Destiny...!"&gt;If This Be My Destiny...!&lt;/a&gt; moment from the comics when it puts Aunt May in danger, but does it so in a half-assed manner, with the classic panel where Spider-Man uses its willpower to scape from danger being used in a Morbius confrontation with almost no dramatic effect. Considering that it is one of the comics most idolized arcs, being used here in such an unconvincing way is what keeps this episode from being great, even though the conflict between Blade, Spider-Man and Morbius creates great action scenes, with Peter desperate to keep the vampire away from his loved ones. Putting Peter's friends and family in the heat of Spider-Man's battles is one of Spider-Man best storytelling devices and &lt;strong&gt;The Immortal Vampire&lt;/strong&gt; uses it for a good effect.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="section" id="tablet-of-time"&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Tablet of Time&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;img alt="Shot from the eleventh episode of the second season of the Spider-Man 1994 television series." class="align-center" src="images/13-11-S02E11-tablet.png" /&gt;
&lt;p class="center"&gt;&lt;em&gt;&amp;quot;Speak for yourself, bugboy. I don't breathe.&amp;quot; - Tombstone&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Written by&lt;/strong&gt;: Mark Hoffmeier, Stan Berkowitz and John Semper.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The one where everybody is kidnapped. The crime lords showdown is back on the spotlight in &lt;strong&gt;Tablet of Time&lt;/strong&gt;. Kingpin and Silvermane are after an ancient artifact known as the Tablet of Time, which has the special power of restore the youth. Dr. Connors and Spider-Man are caught in the middle of this and we have new super robots and new villains - Tombstone and Alisa Silver - to deal with. This episode does a lot of preparation for the final episodes of the season, which the Tablet of Time heavily influences, so the most important parts here are the small character studies that we get a glimpse of. Kingpin has troubles in his marriage since his wife is no longer interested in his line of work. Peter tries to get over Mary Jane and Harry Osborn together and falls right into Alisa Silver's trap. Dr. Connor has to hide away the Lizard once again. While not a groundbreaking or memorable effort, the episode does an appropriate job to setup what comes next on the show.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="section" id="ravages-of-time"&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Ravages of Time&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;img alt="Shot from the twelfth episode of the second season of the Spider-Man 1994 television series." class="align-center" src="images/13-12-S02E12-ravages.png" /&gt;
&lt;p class="center"&gt;&lt;em&gt;&amp;quot;I want to see who is behind the mask.&amp;quot; - Silvermane&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Written by&lt;/strong&gt;: Mark Hoffmeier, Stan Berkowitz and John Semper.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now that's a monkey's paw. Silvermane reaches its goal for youth, but too much of it came through. The best part of &lt;strong&gt;Ravages of Time&lt;/strong&gt; is seeing Silvermane as a baby after all of the hoops to get the Tablet of Time and how Kingpin disposes of it as soon as it acquires for being a reminder of his marriage's problems. The overall sense of waste of time from both villains after the endeavor has a weird humor to it. There were chases, hostage exchanges, scientific experiments and a lot of fighting and nothing was accomplished. Well, at least not for the bad guys, but surprisingly we finished an episode where Spider-Man ends in a place better than where he was at the start, with Dr. Connors being better after receiving the rays from the Tablet of Time. Our hero, though, is still without a cure for its mutation, but at least seeing his friend not suffering is a bright spot in the gloomy atmosphere of the season. This is the weakest storyline of the season - Hydron-Man was a self-contained episode - but we are still advancing towards a finale where Spider-Man still has its unresolved mutation to solve it. While it seems like we are running out of gas in the story and the writers are covering this with crossovers and new characters for the sake of it, the show has earned enough credit for us to have better hope for the final two episodes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="section" id="shriek-of-the-vulture"&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Shriek of the Vulture&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;img alt="Shot from the thirteenth episode of the second season of the Spider-Man 1994 television series." class="align-center" src="images/13-13-S02E13-vulture.png" /&gt;
&lt;p class="center"&gt;&lt;em&gt;&amp;quot;She definitely likes you, pal, so she can't be that smart.&amp;quot; - Peter Parker&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Written by&lt;/strong&gt;: John Semper, Gilles Wheeler and Eyelyn A. R. Gabai.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For the surprise of all, Flash Thompson saves Spider-Man from the Vulture. This episode is an interesting introduction to a member of the rogues gallery that was not yet introduced. The Vulture shares in part the motivations of Silvermane in the previous episodes: have more youth and take out Norman Osborn for the attempted takeover of his company. While the fights and the cliffhanger are fun, the most interesting aspect of the episode is Flash officially going from a bully to a all-american-kind-of-a-buffoon type of hero. His pairing with Debra Whitman works well and the romance between them plays out in natural fashion for a couple of characters that we are not that close in the show. The season goes for its season finale with less tension and darkness than its middle part. Considering that we saw Man-Spider this season, Peter Parker getting old from the hands of the Vulture lacks the drama of the previous storyline. This final stretch of the show's second year is not bad by any means, it just suffers from having to follow-up a strong beginning and middle part of the season.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The Final Nightmare&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;img alt="Shot from the fourteenth episode of the second season of the Spider-Man 1994 television series." class="align-center" src="images/13-14-S02E14-nightmare.png" /&gt;
&lt;p class="center"&gt;&lt;em&gt;&amp;quot;I guess we old folks have to stick together.&amp;quot; - Spider-Man&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="center"&gt;&lt;em&gt;&amp;quot;I had no idea you were a senior citizen.&amp;quot; - Old Lady&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="center"&gt;&lt;em&gt;&amp;quot;It's the job. It ages you.&amp;quot; - Spider-Man&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Written by&lt;/strong&gt;: John Semper and Sandy Fries.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The neogenic nightmare is over. The second season ends in a high note with the Vulture absorbing Spider-Man's mutation and our hero finally being cured after Dr. Connors saves him. But, unfortunately, nothing really good happens with Peter Parker without bad news following it up. Mary Jane mysteriously disappears and this is how the second season ends. Peter can't catch a break. From this last bunch of episodes, this is the best one. Ironically, it's another instance of where the writers combine different villains and characters in a confrontation - Scorpion, Vulture, Lizard and Spider-Man - for multiple reasons, but this one feels more natural thanks to each character having a motivation to use the neogenic recombinator. The irony of the Vulture having the Man-Spider mutation is an interesting twist and another fun monkey's paw moment from the show, but the adventures of an old Peter Parker is my favorite part of the season finale, specially when he has to confront a couple of burglars in an alley. It's a fun episode with a cliffhanger ending that already causes interest for the third season.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That's it. It's been a pleasure to cover the second season of &lt;strong&gt;Spider-Man: TAS&lt;/strong&gt;. The season is darker, works in a much more serious tone and shows a series more comfortable with its storytelling style. The first half is one of the show's best runs and while the final episodes do not have the same excitement, they are solid enough to make this a great season.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now, let's go on to season three.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&amp;quot;Thank you for giving me back my life. What a beautiful day this is gonna be! I feel lucky to be alive. And lucky of being who I am: Spider-Man.&amp;quot; - Spider-Man&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

I decided to rewatch the first season and this is a short review of all episodes. This post was written to the sound of Weezer's &lt;a class="reference external" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Weezer_(Blue_Album)"&gt;Blue Album&lt;/a&gt;. You can listen one of the songs &lt;a class="reference external" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sRfu94lOEPo"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
</summary><content type="html">&lt;p&gt;It's said that your personal experiences make up a small part of what's happened in the world but maybe 80% of how you think the world works*. &lt;strong&gt;Spider-Man: The Animated Series (TAS)&lt;/strong&gt; was the first television show that I religiously followed. I don't even remember my age at the time, but it used to be shown on network TV during weekdays in the morning and I anxiously waited for every episode. Thanks to this series and the fact that I do not follow comic books, my idea of Spider-Man is the version of the story presented here. I'm really excited to write these small bits here, so let's get started...&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;*This also explains why I prefer the movie version that Sam Raimi did instead of the more recent installments, with the exception of the terrible Spider-Man 3, since they are more aligned with this version. Mary Jane Watson &amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt; Gwen Stacy.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Bob Richardson directed all episodes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="section" id="night-of-the-lizard"&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Night of the Lizard&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;img alt="Shot from the first episode of the Spider-Man 1994 television series." class="align-center" src="images/12-01-S01E01-lizard.png" /&gt;
&lt;p class="center"&gt;&lt;em&gt;&amp;quot;What a slimy mess. Why can't I be one of those galaxy hopping superheroes? Why do I end up in the sewers? You don't find the Fantastic Four in the sewer. Or the Avengers. Never do you find the Avengers in the sewers. Or the Defenders. Well, maybe the Hulk.&amp;quot; - Spider-Man&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Written by:&lt;/strong&gt; Gerry Conway, Stan Berkowitz and John Semper.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There's no origin story here. Spider-Man is thrown right into the action to deal with a gigantic reptile that is attacking people in the sewers of New York City. He learns that the creature is his professor and friend Dr. Curt Connors, that used the Neogenic Recombinator to grow back his arm before the equipment turned him on the Lizard.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The pilot is a solid episode. All of the usual suspects, J. Jonah Jameson, Aunt May and Eddie Brock are here and plot elements that will become major parts of the story - like the previously mentioned Neogenic Recombinator - are introduced. This is a good start that shows the difficult financial situation of the Parker family, the bad public perception that Spider-Man has thanks to Jameson and how it's difficult for Peter to balance his life with his responsibilities as a superhero. Everything is packed in twenty minutes on small doses to establish the characters and humor plays a big part, like with the quote above when Spider-Man is in the sewer to fight the Lizard.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="section" id="the-spider-slayer"&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The Spider Slayer&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p class="center"&gt;&lt;em&gt;&amp;quot;I don't stick to walls, see? I can't swing on webs, either. I get airsick.&amp;quot; - Flash Thompson&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Story by&lt;/strong&gt;: John Semper.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Teleplay by&lt;/strong&gt;: Stan Berkowitz.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Considering the target audience, &lt;strong&gt;Spider-Man: TAS&lt;/strong&gt; goes deep in terms of serialized storytelling, small bits of information that don't seem important eventually comes back and the plots get more and more interesting with time. The multi-part episodes are important in this context because it allows the narrative and the characters to be fleshed out in the appropriate pace. This is the first part of the first one that the series made. Since we're early in the series run, we're being slowly introduced to the big players and it's interesting to see how naturally Spider-Man makes enemies. This episode introduces Kingpin, Norman Osborn, Spencer Smythe and Alistair Smythe and their plan to take out the webslinger using robots while Eddie Brock continues his quest for revenge. Also, Felicia Hardy and Flash Tompson show up in a weak subplot where the football player dresses as Spider-Man to scare Peter in Felicia's party.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The episode tries to placate too many moving pieces at the same time. It does not hit home runs in all of them and the Black Widow is never showed as a real threat to Spider-Man. A forgettable effort.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="section" id="return-of-the-spider-slayers"&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Return of the Spider Slayers&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;img alt="Shot from the third episode of the Spider-Man 1994 television series." class="align-center" src="images/12-03-S01E03-return.png" /&gt;
&lt;p class="center"&gt;&lt;em&gt;&amp;quot;Face it, Tiger. You just hit the jackpot.&amp;quot; - Mary Jane Watson&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Story by&lt;/strong&gt;: John Semper.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Teleplay by&lt;/strong&gt;: Mark Hoffmeier.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This was a weird story to tell in a two-part episode. While the previous episode was not a hit, the story of Alistair Smythe aligning himself with the Kingpin is good enough to warrant a continuation, but not exactly right after his father is killed. It would made more sense if the writers did the follow-up later instead of here because this episode was very similar to the first part. Smythe sends robots to attack Spider-Man and everyone involved in &lt;strong&gt;The Spider Slayer&lt;/strong&gt;. Rinse and repeat. There's also a bomb that will detonate in one hour attached to our hero for whatever reason.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Weirdly, the best moment of the series so far comes here: the first appearance of Mary Jane Watson. Just like the comics, she appears at the end to utter her famous line. I guess Peter will change his opinion of blind dates now.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="section" id="doctor-octopus-armed-and-dangerous"&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Doctor Octopus: Armed and Dangerous&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;img alt="Shot from the fourth episode of the Spider-Man 1994 television series." class="align-center" src="images/12-04-S01E04-octopus.png" /&gt;
&lt;p class="center"&gt;&lt;em&gt;&amp;quot;Reminds me of Flash Thompson, all hands.&amp;quot; - Felicia Hardy&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Story by&lt;/strong&gt;: John Semper and Brooks Wachtel.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Teleplay by&lt;/strong&gt;: Brooks Wachtel and Cynthia Harrison.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The best episode of the season so far and we're already seeing the slow introductions to the characters return dividends. Dr. Octopus debuts and his origin story is well presented with the use of flashbacks. The best villains are normally the ones that truly believe that what they're doing is for the greater good and Dr. Octopus is positioned as such here, obsessed with his experiment and kidnapping Felicia Hardy to get revenge on the Hardy family for refusing to support his work and to obtain money to fund it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The script meshes well the protagonist's personal relationship with Felicia alongside his superhero work. Using Peter Parker as the person that delivers the ransom money is a good idea that comes off naturally on screen and the fight scenes between Spider-Man and Dr. Octopus are crafted in a convincing fashion, playing it off the fact that it's two highly-intelligent individuals using their brains to get one over the other. All of the characters are used correctly - even J. Jonah Jameson getting kidnapped because of his mouth makes total sense - and adds up to great twenty minutes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="section" id="the-menace-of-mysterio"&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The Menace of Mysterio&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;img alt="Shot from the fifth episode of the Spider-Man 1994 television series." class="align-center" src="images/12-05-S01E05-mysterio.png" /&gt;
&lt;p class="center"&gt;&lt;em&gt;&amp;quot;I had the power and I didn't use it. I lost my uncle because I ignored my responsibilities. He always used to tell me: with great power comes great responsibility. If I stop being Spider-Man, who else will suffer?&amp;quot; - Peter Parker&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Written by&lt;/strong&gt;: John Semper, Marv Wolfman and Stan Berkowitz.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Mysterio shows up in a plot to frame Spider-Man for a series of robberies while positioning himself as a hero with the help of J. Jonah Jameson. The webslinger has to redeem himself and Peter Parker questions if it's worth it to be Spider-Man since in the whole situation he forgets about his date with Mary Jane.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In this episode we also see one of the main components of the Spider-Man story being brought up for the first time: the murder of Uncle Ben and his importance to the character of Peter Parker. The way the flashbacks and the Mysterio story connect is well done and we can really feel the doubts that Peter has. Is it worthy to sacrifice so much and get so little in return? Maybe not, but running away from the responsibility is a worst option. This dilemma drives the episode and continues the good streak for the series.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="section" id="the-sting-of-the-scorpion"&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The Sting of the Scorpion&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;img alt="Shot from the sixth episode of the Spider-Man 1994 television series." class="align-center" src="images/12-06-S01E06-scorpion.png" /&gt;
&lt;p class="center"&gt;&lt;em&gt;&amp;quot;I knew I should have never left Brooklyn.&amp;quot; - Scorpion&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Written by&lt;/strong&gt;: John Semper, Marv Wolfman and Stan Berkowitz.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;J. Jonah Jameson hires a low-level crook named Marc Gargan with self-steem problems to follow Peter Parker and find out about his relationship with Spider-Man. After his plan fails, he talks to Professor Farley Stillwell to use the Neogenic Recombinator to transform Gargan in a &amp;quot;hero&amp;quot; to take out Spider-Man. Scorpion is born and goes on a rampage all over New York City.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For a cartoon that has only twenty minutes to tell a story, &lt;strong&gt;Spider-Man: TAS&lt;/strong&gt; puts a lot of effort in providing motivations and personalities to every character to makes us sympathize with them. We learn why Jameson hates our hero thanks to a mob hitman with a mask killing his fianceé and pushes him into a more gray area than the position as the series' main villain that he was put previosuly. Even Gargan has certain deep traits for such a simple character, his insecurities associated with the radiation from the Neogenic Recombinator drive him insane and character details like this gives an important spotlight to the supporting players. The episode is a good showing and important because shows that the writers are comfortable and capable to create an universe where there are people outside of Peter that are relevant.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="section" id="kraven-the-hunter"&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Kraven the Hunter&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;img alt="Shot from the seventh episode of the Spider-Man 1994 television series." class="align-center" src="images/12-07-S01E07-kraven.png" /&gt;
&lt;p class="center"&gt;&lt;em&gt;&amp;quot;Welcome to my jungle.&amp;quot; - Kraven&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Story by&lt;/strong&gt;: John Semper and Jan Strnad.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Teleplay by&lt;/strong&gt;: Mark Hoffmeier.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One thing that &lt;strong&gt;Spider-Man: TAS&lt;/strong&gt; did so well in such short amount of time was establish the characters in a convincing manner... until this episode. Spider-Man takes a backseat to a boring love story that serves as the introduction of Kraven the Hunter, a superhuman that was saved by Dr. Mariah Crawford using a drug called the Calypso Serum. He attacks her and kidnaps Robbie.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;All of these three characters are not that well positioned in the series' universe to warrant that much time to their story and Spider-Man is a spectator to all of the action. Sure, he fights crocodiles, but he doesn't drive the narrative. And thanks to the amount of time devoted to the kidnap and the love affair, Peter's subplot where he has to ignore Mary Jane and Felicia Hardy just sounds thrown together at the last minute.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Basically, a safari with a corny villain that ends with Kraven getting an antidote. The weakest installment of the season.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="section" id="the-alien-costume-part-1"&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The Alien Costume, Part 1&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;img alt="Shot from the eight episode of the Spider-Man 1994 television series." class="align-center" src="images/12-08-S01E08-alien-1.png" /&gt;
&lt;p class="center"&gt;&lt;em&gt;&amp;quot;Parker, how on Earth did you get in the middle of Manhattan, hanging upside down in a costume you've never seen before?&amp;quot; - Spider-Man&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Story by&lt;/strong&gt;: Avi Arad and Stan Lee.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Teleplay by&lt;/strong&gt;: Len Wein, Meg McLaughlin, Stan Berkowitz and John Semper.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The three-part episode that brings this series to another level starts here. The Symbiote - and you know who - is one of the most iconic villains of Spider-Man and the narrative here does justice to the character. The best part of the script is that all of the elements that served as pillars of the series so far - Peter's frustation with the lack of recognition he has, J. Jonah Jameson positioning Spider-Man as public enemy number one, Kingpin doing shady deals and Eddie Brock getting screwed - all come together. Also, we get Rhino smashing things and stealing the Promethium X for Kingpin.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This first part has an accelerated pace and gives the necessary substance to each character. It's interesting that it doesn't have subplots or other stories and every major player is gunning for something different inside the same plot.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A great start to this multi-part episode and Peter slow descent into madness - almost killing Rhino - thanks to the Symbiote only gets weirder next.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="section" id="the-alien-costume-part-2"&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The Alien Costume, Part 2&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;img alt="Shot from the ninth episode of the Spider-Man 1994 television series." class="align-center" src="images/12-09-S01E09-alien-2.png" /&gt;
&lt;p class="center"&gt;&lt;em&gt;&amp;quot;You're suppose to be the good guy. You can't do this!&amp;quot; - Shocker&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="center"&gt;&lt;em&gt;&amp;quot;Why not? I have the power.&amp;quot; - Spider-Man&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Story by&lt;/strong&gt;: John Semper and Brynne Stephens.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Teleplay by&lt;/strong&gt;: Brynne Stephens.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Peter's new suit makes him more and more violent while he has to deal with Jameson's bounty. After he learns more about the nature of the suit, he realizes that keeping it may not be the best course of action for his well-being.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While the first part ends with Peter having second thoughts about hurting Rhino, this one ends with the Symbiote assuming the control and almost killing Shocker, our newest addition to the rogues' gallery. Thank goodness, our hero recovers his conscience and reminds himself of the wise words of Uncle Ben. The seamless transformation to insanity of Spider-Man is the main point here and the fits of rage that he throws - including a corny one while chasing Shocker in a church - provides us with great action.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Meanwhile, Jameson has to eat his words and get Spider-Man's help to deal with the kidnap of his son - come to think of it, kidnappings are a common thing in this show - and the writers once again throw him in this uncomfortable position of needing aid.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In his most difficult test so far, Peter has to battle to remember that he's a good person and this story arc continues to prove his fame as the best of the first season.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Oh, and, once again, Eddie Brock gets the short end of the stick. But now he has a new friend to cope with his bad fortunes...&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="section" id="the-alien-costume-part-3"&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The Alien Costume, Part 3&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;img alt="Shot from the tenth episode of the Spider-Man 1994 television series." class="align-center" src="images/12-10-S01E10-alien-3.png" /&gt;
&lt;p class="center"&gt;&lt;em&gt;&amp;quot;You'll see us everywhere, even in your nightmares.&amp;quot; - Venom&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Story by&lt;/strong&gt;: John Semper and Mark Hoffmeier.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Teleplay by&lt;/strong&gt;: Mark Hoffmeier.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The best episode of the first season and the end of a story arc that proves that &lt;strong&gt;Spider-Man: TAS&lt;/strong&gt; is a very mature show for a cartoon. Eddie Brock finally has the means to get revenge on Spider-Man throught the Symbiote. Venom appears and torments Peter's loved ones. The script does a great job at raising the stakes of the confrontation, as Venom knows the webhead's identity and is so consumed by hate that he doesn't think twice before using this knowledge to make Peter suffer. We go through twenty minutes where the villain doesn't stop messing with Peter's head and body, putting the hero in a position where he's outthought and outfought the whole time, even having his mask removed, an opportunity that J. Jonah James can't capitalize on. We jump from one scene to next expecting a breather or a transition to a different scenario, but, nope, there's Venom on top again beating up Spider-Man.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This story arc is impressive because Peter gets to show a lot of different emotions in each episode, from overconfidence to helplessness. Here, it's palpable the fear that he has that Venom can harm Mary Jane and Aunt May and this has him on the brink before being able to use his intelligence to defeat the enemy. All of this is served with great action sequences - the final fight goes on in more than three locations - and a nice ending with him finally having a moment with Mary Jane while they look at the night sky.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="section" id="the-hobgoblin-part-1"&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The Hobgoblin, Part 1&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;img alt="Shot from the eleventh episode of the Spider-Man 1994 television series." class="align-center" src="images/12-11-S01E11-hobgoblin-1.png" /&gt;
&lt;p class="center"&gt;&lt;em&gt;&amp;quot;I want the Kingpin.&amp;quot; - Hobgoblin&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Written by&lt;/strong&gt;: Larry Brody and John Semper.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Introducing the Hobgoblin here is the most questionable decision of the first season considering that it's a completely different approach than the comics. In this two-part episode, that decision may alienate some fans, but it doesn't prevent the story from being fun. The villain appears in a random fashion, but the narrative of a three-way dispute between the Kingpin, Norman Osborn and the Hobgoblin with Spider-Man - and Peter - getting caught in the middle provides us with an episode full of action and double crosses.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is a weird episode because it doesn't care much about providing a backstory to the main villain, trusting that the audience will only recognize the Hobgobling as a power hungry lunatic. The script does a good job at establishing him as a smart figure that puts Osborn and Kingpin against each other with the aim of being the leader of all criminals. The cliffhanger is not the most exciting because we know that the Hobgobling doesn't kill Spider-Man with two bombs and this drags the episode down, but at least we get a closer look at Harry Osborn - that now shares an apartment with Peter - and Kingpin - that uses philanthropy to divert attention from his criminal enterprise.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="section" id="the-hobgoblin-part-2"&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The Hobgoblin, Part 2&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;img alt="Shot from the twelfth episode of the Spider-Man 1994 television series." class="align-center" src="images/12-12-S01E12-hobgoblin-2.png" /&gt;
&lt;p class="center"&gt;&lt;em&gt;&amp;quot;This town has a new Kingpin, Osborn. And it's me!&amp;quot; - Hobgoblin&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Written by&lt;/strong&gt;: Stan Berkowitz.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The enemy of my enemy is my friend is the logic of here. The Hobgoblin takes over Kingpin's criminal enterprise and pays the price soon after. Following the uneasy alliances of the last episode, everything is shuffled here: now Osborn and Kingpin have to take out the Hobgoblin. They use Spider-Man to do their bidding and the irony of the webhead helping them without knowing that Kingpin is pulling his strings is an awesome achievement of the script.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While nothing is as good as &lt;strong&gt;The Alien Costume&lt;/strong&gt; arc, the Hobgoblin's arc has its strong moments, specially the creative fight scene where Spider-Man doesn't have buildings to swing his web to run away from the villain's attacks, having to use his feet and quick thinking.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The season finale brings Chameleon, an international spy, to ruin a peace proposal. SHIELD enlists J. Jonah Jameson to catch him and avoid the murder of two diplomats while Spider-Man sticks his nose in the middle of everything because that's what he does.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Chameleon is a good villain because while he is not presented as a mortal threat to our hero, his gimmick is at least the source of funny material. The rule of this episode is to finish the season in a high note and even when Peter gets caught in a bad situation - Chameleon kisses Mary Jane while disguising as him - the purpose is only comedy. The script is smart and doesn't do a banana peel ending to the story since Chameleon actually gets caught because of two mistakes that he could not avoid.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A smart bad guy, an intelligent good guy, Nick Fury congratulating him and Peter in hot water with Mary Jane... that's quite a good day for our friendly neighborhood Spider-Man.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And that's it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is a light-hearted first season compared to the more serious tone of the rest of the series. &lt;strong&gt;Spider-Man: TAS&lt;/strong&gt; barely missed a step and delivered the goods, specially with the Venom arc. The rogues' gallery was well introduced and the Hobgoblin, Dr. Octopus and Scorpion had great appearances. Kraven and the Spider Slayers were lowlights of the season, but the overall experience was a great reimagination of this brilliant universe.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

I saw 137 movies during the last 5 months and let's talk about 10 of them here. This post was written to the sound of &lt;a class="reference external" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paramore_(album)"&gt;Paramore's&lt;/a&gt; self-titled album. You can listen one of the songs &lt;a class="reference external" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OblL026SvD4"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
</summary><content type="html">&lt;p&gt;This text is not about the &lt;strong&gt;best&lt;/strong&gt; movies that I watched during this period. It's about movies that I thought that, for whatever reason, I should write about. All of them are interesting and I even rewatched a few before publishing this post, so you should absolutely check them out in case you are looking for recommendations.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="section" id="o-caso-dos-irmaos-naves-1967"&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;O Caso dos Irmãos Naves (1967)&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;img alt="Shot from the movie O Caso dos Irmãos Naves, made in 1967" class="align-center" src="images/11-01-naves.png" /&gt;
&lt;p class="center"&gt;&lt;em&gt;&amp;quot;Here.&amp;quot; - Multiple officers&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Director:&lt;/strong&gt; Luís Sérgio Person.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The plot:&lt;/strong&gt; A man disappear with a large sum of money and the investigation leads to one of the biggest mistakes in the history of Brazil's judiciary system. Two brothers are arrested and tortured to obtain a confession even though they did not commit the crime.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Why is it here:&lt;/strong&gt; This is of the most gut-wrenching brazilian movies ever made. The torture scenes are intense and the police's lack of moral character puts the viewer in a uncomfortable position throughout 90 minutes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The scene:&lt;/strong&gt; The police forces one of the Naves brothers to search for the stolen money in an empty field. They know that there's no money to be found there and still torture an innocent man only to play with his mind.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="section" id="twilight-zone-the-movie-1983"&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Twilight Zone: The Movie (1983)&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;img alt="Shot from the movie Twilight Zone, made in 1983" class="align-center" src="images/11-02-twilight.png" /&gt;
&lt;p class="center"&gt;&lt;em&gt;&amp;quot;Do you want to see something really scary?&amp;quot; - The Passenger&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Director:&lt;/strong&gt; John Landis, Steven Spielberg, Joe Dante and George Miller.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The plot:&lt;/strong&gt; A remake of three episodes of the original Twilight Zone.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Why is it here:&lt;/strong&gt; The whole movie is uneven at best, but everything starts with a bang. The opening scene is a beautiful combination of humor, horror and homage to the original TV series. In the category &amp;quot;Movies that start brilliantly only to have not-so-great follow-ups&amp;quot;, this one only loses to &lt;a class="reference external" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HVy-TSs7Gio"&gt;When a Stranger Calls&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The scene:&lt;/strong&gt; The opening scene where Albert Brooks and Dan Aykroyd discuss the most scary episodes of The Twilight Zone.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="section" id="spoorloos-1988"&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Spoorloos (1988)&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;img alt="Shot from the movie Spoorloos, made in 1988" class="align-center" src="images/11-03-vanishing.png" /&gt;
&lt;p class="center"&gt;&lt;em&gt;&amp;quot;But I want you to know, for me killing is not the worst thing.&amp;quot; - Raymond Lemorne&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Director:&lt;/strong&gt; George Sluizer.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The plot:&lt;/strong&gt; A couple is travelling on holiday in France and while they stop to refuel, the girl enters to buy drinks and is never seen again. Her boyfriend enters a multi-year saga to find out what happened.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Why is it here:&lt;/strong&gt; It has one of the most acclaimed endings in cinema history, but the movie as a whole offers much more. Spoorloos is a dense study about obsession and how humanity's dark side develops over time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The scene:&lt;/strong&gt; The ending sequence where we discover what happened.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="section" id="a-quiet-place-2018"&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;A Quiet Place (2018)&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;img alt="Shot from the movie A Quiet Place, made in 2018" class="align-center" src="images/11-04-quiet.png" /&gt;
&lt;p class="center"&gt;&lt;em&gt;&amp;quot;I love you. I have always loved you.&amp;quot; - Lee Abbott&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Director:&lt;/strong&gt; John Krasinski.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The plot:&lt;/strong&gt; A family struggles to survive in a post-apocalyptic world where humanity must scape from monsters that are attracted to sound.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Why is it here:&lt;/strong&gt; Because a well-made movie where the characters are not allowed to speak is an impressive feat. A Quiet Place creates incredible tension with the use of silence and shows that Krasinski is quite a skilled director, able to convey a thriller where the course of action for the characters is to avoid confrontations with the monsters instead of battling them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The scene:&lt;/strong&gt; The sacrifice scene.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="section" id="hitman-hart-wrestling-with-shadows-1998"&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Hitman Hart: Wrestling with Shadows (1998)&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;img alt="Shot from the movie Hitman Hart: Wrestling with Shadows, made in 1998" class="align-center" src="images/11-05-hitman.png" /&gt;
&lt;p class="center"&gt;&lt;em&gt;&amp;quot;Bret screwed Bret. I have no sympathy whatsoever for Bret.&amp;quot; - Vince McMahon&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Director:&lt;/strong&gt; Paul Jay.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The plot:&lt;/strong&gt; A documentary following professional wrestler Bret &amp;quot;The Hitman&amp;quot; Hart during his final months in the World Wrestling Federation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Why is it here:&lt;/strong&gt; I've watched a ton of documentaries in the timeframe described above and chose two for this list. This one is here for a couple of reasons: it reminded me of 2008, when professional wrestling started to be broadcasted on network TV here in Brazil and I watched with my uncle, and also because it's a really underrated gem. This is a rise and fall story of a man that took pride in his profession, saw his boss as a father figure and was unable to adapt to his audience's newly-acquired preference in anti-heroes as protagonists instead of goody two-shoes personas. All of this and a company in financial peril culminated in a depressing night in Montreal.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The scene:&lt;/strong&gt; After the movie's defining moment, the mind responsible for everything explains his actions on live television.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="section" id="drag-me-to-hell-2009"&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Drag Me to Hell (2009)&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;img alt="Shot from the movie Drag Me to Hell, made in 2009" class="align-center" src="images/11-06-hell.png" /&gt;
&lt;p class="center"&gt;&lt;em&gt;&amp;quot;I did what you said! I killed a little kitty!&amp;quot; - Christine Brown&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Director:&lt;/strong&gt; Sam Raimi.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The plot:&lt;/strong&gt; A loan officer chooses not to give an extension to the mortgage of an old lady. The lady in question is a gypsy woman with a blind eye and retaliates with a curse that makes the next few days of the protagonist's life a living hell.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Why is it here:&lt;/strong&gt; Sam Raimi directed two of my favorite movie series, the Tobey Maguire Spider-Man movies (I know the third one is terrible) and Evil Dead, but those are the only movies of his that I watched before looking into Drag Me to Hell. This movie is a campy ride with some funny bits and weird horror sequences. The textbook definition of good, but not much more.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The scene:&lt;/strong&gt; The fight scene in the garage.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="section" id="el-secreto-de-sus-ojos-2009"&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;El Secreto de sus Ojos (2009)&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;img alt="Shot from the movie El Secreto de sus Ojos, made in 2009" class="align-center" src="images/11-07-eyes.png" /&gt;
&lt;p class="center"&gt;&lt;em&gt;&amp;quot;A guy can change anything. His face, his home, his family, his girlfriend, his religion, his God. But there's one thing he can't change. He can't change his passion.&amp;quot; - Pablo Sandoval&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Director:&lt;/strong&gt; Juan José Campanella.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The plot:&lt;/strong&gt; A woman is raped and murdered and the characters involved in the investigation are followed through 25 years in a nonlinear narrative.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Why is it here:&lt;/strong&gt; A modern classic from Argentina, El Secreto de sus Ojos deals with the theme of passion, showing its good and bad side in a beautiful love story and a twisted murder. Everybody in this movie is hiding something and Juan José Campanella shines in the direction with the lovely use of close-ups to bring the characters' eyes into the forefront. Since the eyes are the windows to the soul, nothing here stays hidden for too long and the result is a memorable journey through the years.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The scene:&lt;/strong&gt; The chase inside &lt;em&gt;El Cilindro&lt;/em&gt;. God bless the souls that filmed this sequence, an amazing achievement.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="section" id="enron-the-smartest-guys-in-the-room-2005"&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Enron: The Smartest Guys in the Room (2005)&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;img alt="Shot from the movie Enron: The Smartest Guys in the Room, made in 2005" class="align-center" src="images/11-08-enron.png" /&gt;
&lt;p class="center"&gt;&lt;em&gt;&amp;quot;We are the good guys. We are on the side of angels.&amp;quot; - Jeffrey Skilling&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Director:&lt;/strong&gt; Alex Gibney.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The plot:&lt;/strong&gt; A documentary about the fall of the Enron Corporation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Why is it here:&lt;/strong&gt; After COVID-19 and the subprime crisis, it seems that the Enron scandal is something from another era, but it has been less than 20 years since what appeared to be an energy empire crumbled down in less than a month. This documentary really knows which buttons to push to make the audience angry with the multiple crimes committed. The way that Alex Gibney peels the onion and makes you angrier and angrier with the actions of Enron makes this a must-watch documentary.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The scene:&lt;/strong&gt; A lineman from a power company that Enron bought learns that his retirement fund went from $250,000 to $1,000. He'll never retire.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="section" id="spirited-away-2001"&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Spirited Away (2001)&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;img alt="Shot from the movie Spirited Away, made in 2001" class="align-center" src="images/11-09-spirited.png" /&gt;
&lt;p class="center"&gt;&lt;em&gt;&amp;quot;I promise I'll get you out of here, just don't get any fatter or they'll eat you.&amp;quot; - Chihiro Ogino&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Director:&lt;/strong&gt; Hayao Miyazaki.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The plot:&lt;/strong&gt; A 10-year-old girl enters the world of spirits after her parents are turned into pigs by a witch.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Why is it here:&lt;/strong&gt; It's the japanese Alice in Wonderland and Miyazaki shows us once again how beautiful hand-drawn animation is. Spirited Away is more than a movie, it's an experience.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The scene:&lt;/strong&gt; The ride in the train.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="section" id="the-apartment-1960"&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The Apartment (1960)&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;img alt="Shot from the movie The Apartment, made in 1960" class="align-center" src="images/11-10-apartment.png" /&gt;
&lt;p class="center"&gt;&lt;em&gt;&amp;quot;Shut up and deal.&amp;quot; - Fran Kubelik&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Director:&lt;/strong&gt; Billy Wilder.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The plot:&lt;/strong&gt; An insurance clerk allows senior coworkers to have affairs in his apartment to help him climb the corporate ladder. He's also in love with the building's elevator girl.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Why is it here:&lt;/strong&gt; The Apartment goes deeper than the average romantic comedy. It's funny? Yep. The leads have amazing chemistry? Absolutely. But there's just a hint of sadness and loneliness injected in this group of broken characters that pushes this movie over the line, making it one of the best and most rewatchable films ever made. It meshes all of these elements so naturally and with such delicacy that even the absurd premise sounds like a normal day at the office.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The scene:&lt;/strong&gt; The ending. A lot of romantic comedies end in similar fashion. They end this way because of the brilliance of this movie final sequence.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That's it. I'm interested in watching more movies in the near future. I wrote movie and TV reviews during my teen years and it has always been a pleasure of mine. While adult life limits my time to write extensive reviews, I plan to add some sort of frequency to my posts here and quick texts about movies are a good alternative. Let's see what the future holds.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

Let's talk a little bit about this process and this awesome beginning. This post was written to the sound of the &lt;a class="reference external" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Top_Gun_(soundtrack)"&gt;soundtrack from Top Gun&lt;/a&gt;. You can listen one of the songs &lt;a class="reference external" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=siwpn14IE7E"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
</summary><content type="html">&lt;p&gt;Wow.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What a ride the last few months have been.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As you may already figured out, I got hired by Amazon after graduating from college.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To be more specific, I'm currently part of Amazon Web Services (AWS).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To be even more specific, I'm a part of AWS Tech U Program, a special program for new graduates to train them to become Solutions Architects. I got the opportunity to move from my hometown, Natal, to Latin America's biggest city - in terms of population, Sao Paulo. It was a brilliant recruitment experience and an amazing onboarding process at AWS.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But, then, the world stopped.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;COVID-19 happened.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I actually spent just one week on-premises before AWS decided that I could work from home during the pandemic. I didn't even setup my workspace properly. There's probably an unplugged HDMI cable hanging out at my desk as you're reading this.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I'm not going to dwell much about the situation since everybody is living it, but I would like to point it out how grateful - some might say even lucky - I am right now to have started my career here. The carnage from the pandemic can not be understated. I got relatives and friends that lost jobs as soon as the quarantines started. Of course, as almost everyone on planet Earth right now, I'm a little bit anxious about my future, but so far I'm grateful that the effects haven't affected the program - even though anything can happen. The only thing I can do is work hard and be mindful about my health and the health of everyone around me.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Actually, that's not the only thing I can do. I can watch Married... with Children. I'm currently on season 3. Jim Halpert may have to watch out, Al Bundy is making a big case to be my new favorite TV character.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Anyways, I hope that everything comes back to normal as soon as possible. COVID-19 looks like my generation's defining moment... and I'm sure we will overcome it.&lt;/p&gt;

This post was written to the sound of The Police's &lt;a class="reference external" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Outlandos_d%27Amour"&gt;Outlandos d'Amour'&lt;/a&gt;. You can listen one of the songs &lt;a class="reference external" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nH0vjLwMyc4"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
</summary><content type="html">&lt;p&gt;I participated in my second data science competition last month and it was again a worthy experience.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My team, composed of myself and two friends, competed with 131 teams from all over the world at &lt;a class="reference external" href="https://www.cfm.fr/"&gt;Capital Fund Management&lt;/a&gt;’s 2019 supervised machine learning challenge, hosted at &lt;a class="reference external" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/%C3%89cole_normale_sup%C3%A9rieure_(Paris)"&gt;ENS&lt;/a&gt;’s &lt;a class="reference external" href="https://challengedata.ens.fr/"&gt;Challenge Data&lt;/a&gt; platform.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The goal was to predict sign accuracy using anonymized US stock returns data, a highly stochastic dataset with 1 million lines and 74 columns (training + test).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The group split between different tasks such as feature engineering, essaying neural network architectures (my part) and AutoML frameworks, and applying traditional ML methods like GBMs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Our best submission was a CNN-based one that unfortunately overfit the training data a little, which gave us the final ranking of 15.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We did this in less than a month. I believe that we will participate again this year and we're going to go even further since we have more time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The first place wins an iPad. I never had one and, oh boy, I want it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After winning in 2020, all three of us then can become quant traders and be filthy rich for the rest of our lives. Finance is awesome!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Stay tuned next year to find out if the plan goes accordingly.&lt;/p&gt;

This post was written to the sound of &lt;a class="reference external" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Doors_(album)"&gt;The Doors'&lt;/a&gt; eponymous album. You can listen one of the songs &lt;a class="reference external" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BXqPNlng6uI"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
</summary><content type="html">&lt;p&gt;So, I'm only a few days away from officially becoming an electrical engineer. The final step was taken last thursday. I did my presentation and the professors loved it. One of the them even invited me to do my master's degree with him.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here's the official photo:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;img alt="Professor Max Chianca, myself and professor Marcos Dias." class="align-center" src="images/08-01-Final-Project-Presentation.jpeg" /&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you didn't realized yet from older posts, I'm always the tall one.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My final project was a very easy one. Last july, during my Electrical Substations class, the professor suggested that developing a program to design grounding grids for substations alongside a tool for soil stratification would be a good idea for a final project. I thought to myself &amp;quot;Hey, I can do this very quickly&amp;quot; and I did it in two weeks.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Originally, I did it on MATLAB. In the beginning of september I think, I decided to develop an API using Django and put it up on Heroku. Then, I created a small form to consume the API and used Heroku again to leave it online.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The MATLAB and Python code can be found on &lt;a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/andrefellipe/esd"&gt;GitHub&lt;/a&gt; and the live website is on this weird &lt;a class="reference external" href="https://grounding-design.herokuapp.com/index.html"&gt;link&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The math behind everything is not very difficult and I'm not going to dwell on it much. Basically, we have to minimize this function to do the soil stratification with two layers:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;img alt="Least squares equation for two-layer soil stratification." class="align-center" src="images/08-02-Equation.png" /&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Also, there's a block diagram on the standard IEEE 80-2000 that I followed to check if the grounding grid has adequate touch and step voltages:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;img alt="Design procedure block diagram." class="align-center" src="images/08-03-Design-Procedure-Block-Diagram.png" /&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Even though this is not a difficult project, I liked because it was something that was done very quickly. I loved because I did it very early and had the time to focus on more important things for my career.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you need a simple tool to do soil stratification and check if your rectangular grounding grid is safe, you're good to go.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The end.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I'm a electrical engineer now.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Let's see what the future holds.&lt;/p&gt;

This post was written to the sound of The Killers' &lt;a class="reference external" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hot_Fuss"&gt;Hot Fuss&lt;/a&gt;. You can listen one of the songs &lt;a class="reference external" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gGdGFtwCNBE"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
</summary><content type="html">&lt;p&gt;A colleague of mine invited me to create a team to win the 2019 UFRN Data Science Competition last month. I've never participated in one before and I thought that it was a cool experience. Our five-person group had a couple of days to do any kind of analysis on meteorological data provided by INMET, the government agency responsible for this kind of stuff.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We had to move quickly and precisely to bring to the public a creative analysis of a lot of data - basically everything related to temperatures, humidity, wind and similar variables from 1961 to today from every part of Brazil.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We visualized the impact that this year's Amazon fires had on the data through geospatially visualizing temperature differences according to a baseline, running a PCA and investigating spatial patterns, and forecasting temperatures to look for anomalies. My job was to do the last part using this cool tool from Facebook called &lt;a class="reference external" href="https://facebook.github.io/prophet/docs/quick_start.html"&gt;Prophet&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Unfortunately, we came up short and got second place. I honestly believe that we should have won it and one member of my team even argued with the judges a little bit, but to no avail.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It was a cool debut, though. Right now, we are getting prepared to try again in similar competitions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The most unfortunate part of everything was the fact that when we got to the front to receive our medals, there were two cameras, one from one of the professors and the official one of the event. I didn't notice that and put my focus on the professor's one.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So, yeah, I look kind of stupid in the picture.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;img alt="The whole team receiving the medals." class="align-center" src="images/07-01-Team-Picture.jpeg" /&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Jesus, sometimes I forget how tall I am.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The final presentation and all of the code can be found on GitHub. You can access it with this &lt;a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/vitorsr/ccd"&gt;link&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And through this &lt;a class="reference external" href="https://marcusnunes.me/posts/resultados-da-competicao-de-ciencia-de-dados-da-ufrn-2019/"&gt;one&lt;/a&gt;, you can check out more information about the competition. If you know brazilian portuguese, that is.&lt;/p&gt;

This post was written to the sound of The Clash's &lt;a class="reference external" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/London_Calling"&gt;London Calling&lt;/a&gt;. You can listen one of the songs &lt;a class="reference external" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ertt3o1x65c"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
</summary><content type="html">&lt;p&gt;During the first semester of 2018, I was an intern at a small local company. The company's name is &lt;a class="reference external" href="https://www.engenhariaequalidade.com.br/"&gt;Engenharia &amp;amp; Qualidade&lt;/a&gt; and it has been around for more than two decades. It has 10 employees as of May/2019, including the two main partners, and a long range of services that goes from structured cabling to studies of grounding and soil resistivity testing of substations. Basically, the company can solve anything in the fields of electrical installations and telecommunications thanks to the expertise of its two owners. Its major client is one of the biggest (if not the biggest) supermarket chains of my state, &lt;a class="reference external" href="http://www.nordestao.com.br/"&gt;Nordestão&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In my internship, I was responsible for the budgets and, sometimes, the supervision of the execution of some projects. As you may already know, there was a lot of Excel and AutoCAD involved. It was a brilliant experience, but, after my six months there, I came to the conclusion that this would not be something that I would like to do for a living.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I decided to not renew my contract after one semester. During my time there, I automated a lot of the tasks on the spreadsheets that the company had, but there was a gap because we used a lot of different management tools. Excel for the budget, an old software made with VB to manage the clients and the warehouse, a physical book that the employees signed with the worked hours, etc. One of my ideas after dealing with all of that was to replace everything with something that could unify everything the company did.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I wasn't able to implement the system while I was an intern because my actual job (budgets and supervision of projects) didn't allowed me the time. This year, however, I approached the owners with this idea and they thought it would be great if I developed a website with all of necessary functionalities. We agreed on a price and, during the months of march and april, I've developed E&amp;amp;Q Online, a website hosted at the company own server to internal use.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is the login screen:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;img alt="The login screen." class="align-center" src="images/06-01-EQ-01.png" /&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And this is the homepage after the user logs in:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;img alt="The homepage after the login screen." class="align-center" src="images/06-02-EQ-02.png" /&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Thanks to the agreement between me and the owners, I am going to be very selective of what parts of the website I am going to discuss here.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As you can see, there's nine areas in the platform: &lt;strong&gt;Log&lt;/strong&gt;, &lt;strong&gt;Users&lt;/strong&gt;, &lt;strong&gt;Suppliers&lt;/strong&gt;, &lt;strong&gt;Clients&lt;/strong&gt;, &lt;strong&gt;Transport&lt;/strong&gt;, &lt;strong&gt;Warehouse&lt;/strong&gt;, &lt;strong&gt;Proposals&lt;/strong&gt;, &lt;strong&gt;Orders&lt;/strong&gt; and &lt;strong&gt;Accounts&lt;/strong&gt;. Let's do a brief rundown of each:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="section" id="log"&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Log&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here, the users can register when they arrive at the company, when they go out to lunch, when they return and when they leave. Also, the users are able to register any missing day. The users in the &lt;strong&gt;Administrator&lt;/strong&gt; category can see, update or delete the records and missing days from all of the users. If the user is not a part of this category, he can only see his own records.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here's the screen where the user can choose what's the type of logging that he's doing it:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;img alt="The screen where the user can choose the type of logging." class="align-center" src="images/06-03-EQ-03.png" /&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If the user chooses the first option, he's going to register that he has arrived at the company. After the confirmation, a new record is created with the current timestamp.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;img alt="The screen where the user can log in." class="align-center" src="images/06-04-EQ-04.png" /&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As I said before, an administrator can see all of the records in a very friendly manner. He's able to search for any record by using any parameter (the name of the user, the date, the type of entry, etc) and he can update or delete any record:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;img alt="The screen with all records." class="align-center" src="images/06-05-EQ-05.png" /&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The user can also create a record of absence if he missed a day:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;img alt="The screen where the user can register an absence." class="align-center" src="images/06-06-EQ-06.png" /&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And an administrator can see all absences. In this particular print, there isn't one registered yet.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;img alt="The screen where the user can see all absences." class="align-center" src="images/06-07-EQ-07.png" /&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="section" id="users"&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Users&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the Users section, an administrator can create, update or delete an user:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;img alt="The screen where the user can see all registered users." class="align-center" src="images/06-08-EQ-08.png" /&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Also, as you can see, the users can alter their passwords. An important part of the &lt;strong&gt;Users&lt;/strong&gt; section is that every week an email is sent to the administrators with the due date of the users' documents. This is relevant because they can see when the document is going to expire and renew it at the right time. Before E&amp;amp;Q Online, the company was not used to keep track of the due dates. So, when a project showed up, part of the workforce would not be able to work because some certification was expired. Right now, the administrators receive a list informing how many days are left, as you can see below:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;img alt="Example of the email that the administrators receive with the users' documents and their due dates." class="align-center" src="images/06-09-EQ-09.png" /&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="section" id="clients-and-suppliers"&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Clients and Suppliers&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;These two sections are basically the same. Create, update and delete the clients and the suppliers of the company. It's worth nothing that one of the most annoying parts of the project was finding out how to retrieve the database already in use in the old software to put it on the website. There where more than one thousand clients and suppliers combined in the old database and the data was in a different setup than the one that we need here, since we'll be connecting these clients and suppliers to other parts of the website. Importing the data from the Access database to the MySQL one that the site uses took almost a full afternoon of work.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;img alt="The screen where the user can see all registered suppliers." class="align-center" src="images/06-10-EQ-10.png" /&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="section" id="transport"&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Transport&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This section is divided in &lt;strong&gt;Vehicles&lt;/strong&gt;, &lt;strong&gt;Travels&lt;/strong&gt;, &lt;strong&gt;Refuels&lt;/strong&gt; and &lt;strong&gt;Maintenances&lt;/strong&gt;. Here, we can create, update or delete each one of those things. Below you can see a screenshot of a refuel where the gas station listed is from the registered &lt;strong&gt;Suppliers&lt;/strong&gt; section:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;img alt="The screen where the user can see all registered refuels." class="align-center" src="images/06-11-EQ-11.png" /&gt;
&lt;p&gt;An old problem that has been solved is related to the inspections of the tools that are in the cars. Since the workers are in movement everyday, they need to keep equipment from the warehouse inside the cars and the company needs to ocasionally check if everything that was taken from the warehouse is in the car. If, for instance, a worker loses a screwdriver, the company needs to know and charge him for the slip. That's why in the &lt;strong&gt;Vehicles&lt;/strong&gt; section each vehicle has an inspection button where the user (generally it's the job of an intern to do the inspection) can see a list of the current tools there and check if everything matches. The list of current tools is automatically generated, a feature that we will see in the following section.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="section" id="warehouse"&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Warehouse&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The warehouse has more than 1.500 products and tools that the company can sell or use in a project. Here, we can basically create, update or delete a product, move the project, keep track of every movement and generate the SPED report, a list with the products and important information that the company needs to send every year to the &lt;em&gt;Receita Federal&lt;/em&gt;, our version of the IRS.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As you can see below, there's three important buttons to move products around.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We can make the products go in the warehouse (if we buy a 10 meters of cable and add it to the warehouse, this is the option).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We can make products go from the warehouse to a service (if we need to take 3 meters of cable and use it in a project, this is the option), we can also make products go from the warehouse to a vehicle or a toolbox (as we kind of pointed out in the section before this one, this is how we keep track of the tools inside the vehicles).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And, in the third button, we can return products from a car, a toolbox or a service to the warehouse (if we took 3 meters of cable to use it on a project, but only needed one, we can return two so that we can appropriately charge the client only the one that was used).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;img alt="The screen where the user can see all options in the Warehouse section." class="align-center" src="images/06-12-EQ-12.png" /&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In this example below, we are moving 20 meters of cable that will be used in a project registered (more about orders of service later):&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;img alt="An example of how to move a product out from the warehouse to a service." class="align-center" src="images/06-13-EQ-13.png" /&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As you can see in the screenshot below, all of these movements can be seen in this section of the website:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;img alt="The screen where the user can see all registered movements." class="align-center" src="images/06-14-EQ-14.png" /&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We can also generate the data that the company has to send to the government every year. Here's a snippet of this report:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;img alt="The screen where the user can see all registered movements." class="align-center" src="images/06-15-EQ-15.png" /&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To finish, there's the &lt;strong&gt;Toolbox&lt;/strong&gt; subsection, but it's very similar to the &lt;strong&gt;Vehicles&lt;/strong&gt; one. You can create, update and delete toolboxes and make inspections of its contents.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="section" id="proposals"&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Proposals&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is the section where we develop the budgets for the services and generate business proposals to send the clients. It's also where we can add services and update their prices. If the company adds to its catalog of services, for instance, &amp;quot;Install photovoltaic panel&amp;quot; and charges R$ 1.000,00 per panel, we can add here so that we can use it in the proposal. Or, in another instance, if the price of &amp;quot;Certification Test for CAT. 6 cable&amp;quot; goes up, we need to update it so that we can make the more recent proposals with the new price.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To formulate a budget, we need to choose who is the client that we're sending the proposal and list all of the products and services that are needed to do the project. After that, the website calculates how much the material is going to cost, how much the services are going to cost, how much would it cost to do it during business hours and how much would it cost to do it out of the business hours (more expensive).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;img alt="The screen where the user can calculate the total of a proposal - part 01." class="align-center" src="images/06-16-EQ-16.png" /&gt;
&lt;img alt="The screen where the user can calculate the total of a proposal - part 02." class="align-center" src="images/06-17-EQ-17.png" /&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With all of the prices calculated, the user can create a business proposal to sent it via email to the client and generate lists with the materials and the services needed to this project.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;img alt="The screen with an example of a proposal." class="align-center" src="images/06-18-EQ-18.png" /&gt;
&lt;img alt="The screen with an example of a list of materials." class="align-center" src="images/06-19-EQ-19.png" /&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The example above is totally random.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="section" id="orders"&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Orders&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If a proposal is accepted, when the workers go out to execute the project, we need to generate an order. This is what this section is all about. We can update the status of the order (if it's ongoing or if it's finished), we can generate a list with all of the products used in the order (based on the movements that we did at the &lt;strong&gt;Warehouse&lt;/strong&gt; section) and we can print the order so that the workers can take it to the field and fill the informations that the company need.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;img alt="The screen with an example of an order." class="align-center" src="images/06-20-EQ-20.png" /&gt;
&lt;img alt="The screen with an example of a list of materials that went out to the service." class="align-center" src="images/06-21-EQ-21.png" /&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="section" id="accounts"&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Accounts&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This section is simply about creating, updating and deleting accounts, meaning bills to pay and bills to receive. That's it. Just a few CRUDs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="section" id="final-thoughts"&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Final Thoughts&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That's everything. I've tried to summarize the main points of this project. It's a basic, but very functional HTML, CSS, JavaScript, PHP and MySQL combo. There's a couple of libraries and plugins that helped a lot, like jQuery, Bootstrap, RainTPL, Composer, PHPMailer and a couple of others that I don't recall at this moment.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The expectation is that we can increase the company's productivity with the website and I'm very confident that this will be achieved.&lt;/p&gt;

This post was written to the sound of Hall &amp;amp; Oates' &lt;a class="reference external" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Big_Bam_Boom"&gt;Big Bam Boom&lt;/a&gt;. You can listen one of the songs &lt;a class="reference external" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s_8KR-n2fBQ"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
</summary><content type="html">&lt;p&gt;This tutorial will not teach you how to compile your own OpenCV using the source code. I recommend that you try this at a future date for learning purposes. At this moment, let's try a different approach. I am using Ubuntu 18.04 and this tutorial will only work for distributions of the Linux operating system. You will see why below.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Also, I expect that you have a general knowledge about Java. If you know nothing about it so far, just follow the instructions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Let's dive in!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="section" id="checking-if-you-have-java"&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Checking if you have Java&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Open the terminal (ctrl + alt + T).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Run the following command to check if you already have Java:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="highlight"&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="gp"&gt;$ &lt;/span&gt;java -version
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You are good to go if you see something like this:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="highlight"&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="go"&gt;java version &amp;quot;1.8.0_181&amp;quot;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="go"&gt;Java(TM) SE Runtime Environment (build 1.8.0_181-b13)&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="go"&gt;Java HotSpot(TM) 64-Bit Server VM (build 25.181-b13, mixed mode)&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You may have another version of Oracle's Java or OpenJDK, but this should not be a problem.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you do not see the message above or something similar, you will need to install Java. If you can see the message, jump to the next section.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Run the following commands to install Oracle's Java 8:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="highlight"&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="gp"&gt;$ &lt;/span&gt;sudo add-apt-repository ppa:webupd8team/java
&lt;span class="gp"&gt;$ &lt;/span&gt;sudo apt-get update
&lt;span class="gp"&gt;$ &lt;/span&gt;sudo apt-get install oracle-java8-installer
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Run the &lt;strong&gt;java -version&lt;/strong&gt; command again to make sure everything is fine.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="section" id="download-opencv"&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Download OpenCV&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Run the following command to install the OpenCV library:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="highlight"&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="gp"&gt;$ &lt;/span&gt;sudo apt-get install libopencv-dev
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That's it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="section" id="creating-our-first-program"&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Creating Our First Program&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Using your favorite text editor, create a file named &lt;strong&gt;HelloOpenCVJava.java&lt;/strong&gt;. I am using &lt;a class="reference external" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vim_(text_editor)"&gt;Vim&lt;/a&gt;, so the command would be:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="highlight"&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="gp"&gt;$ &lt;/span&gt;vim HelloOpenCVJava.java
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now, copy and paste the following code:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="highlight"&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="kn"&gt;import&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nn"&gt;org.opencv.core.Core&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class="kd"&gt;public&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="kd"&gt;class&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nc"&gt;HelloOpenCVJava&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;

  &lt;span class="cm"&gt;/** Loading the OpenCV library. */&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="kd"&gt;static&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="n"&gt;System&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="na"&gt;loadLibrary&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;Core&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="na"&gt;NATIVE_LIBRARY_NAME&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;);&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;

  &lt;span class="kd"&gt;public&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="kd"&gt;static&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="kt"&gt;void&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nf"&gt;main&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;String&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;[]&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;args&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;

    &lt;span class="cm"&gt;/** Printing the OpenCV version. */&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="n"&gt;System&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="na"&gt;out&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="na"&gt;println&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s"&gt;&amp;quot;Hello OpenCV &amp;quot;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;+&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;Core&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="na"&gt;VERSION&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;+&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="s"&gt;&amp;quot;!&amp;quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;);&lt;/span&gt;

    &lt;span class="cm"&gt;/** Printing the Java version. */&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="n"&gt;System&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="na"&gt;out&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="na"&gt;println&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s"&gt;&amp;quot;Hello to you too, Java &amp;quot;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;+&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;System&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="na"&gt;getProperty&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s"&gt;&amp;quot;java.version&amp;quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;+&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="s"&gt;&amp;quot;!&amp;quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;);&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Let's breakdown the &lt;strong&gt;HelloOpenCVJava&lt;/strong&gt; application.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The &lt;strong&gt;import&lt;/strong&gt; keyword is necessary to load the &lt;strong&gt;Core&lt;/strong&gt; class from the OpenCV library.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We use the &lt;strong&gt;NATIVE_LIBRARY_NAME&lt;/strong&gt; property of the Core class to find the corresponding name of the library and use as parameter to the &lt;strong&gt;loadLibrary&lt;/strong&gt; method. In this case, it returns &lt;strong&gt;opencv_java320&lt;/strong&gt;. This will allow us to use the OpenCV library. After that, we print the versions of the library and Java.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="section" id="compiling-and-running-helloopencvjava"&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Compiling and Running HelloOpenCVJava&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Your project directory must be looking like this right now:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="highlight"&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="go"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="go"&gt;|__ HelloOpenCVJava.java&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If it is, run the following command to compile HelloOpenCVJava.java:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="highlight"&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="gp"&gt;$ &lt;/span&gt;javac -cp /usr/share/OpenCV/java/opencv-320.jar HelloOpenCVJava.java
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now you should have your bytecode class file &lt;strong&gt;HelloOpenCVJava.class&lt;/strong&gt;. Here's how the directory should look like:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="highlight"&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="go"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="go"&gt;|__ HelloOpenCVJava.class&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="go"&gt;|__ HelloOpenCVJava.java&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The &lt;a class="reference external" href="https://docs.oracle.com/javase/8/docs/technotes/tools/windows/findingclasses.html#BABBFCIJ"&gt;-cp flag&lt;/a&gt; tells the compiler to set the system property java.class.path, which is a list of directories, JAR files and ZIP files that contain class files. We are using here to indicate that we want to find our &lt;strong&gt;opencv-320.jar&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We have everything we need to run our application now. We do this with the following command:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="highlight"&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="gp"&gt;$ &lt;/span&gt;java -Djava.library.path&lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;/usr/lib/jni -cp /usr/share/OpenCV/java/opencv-320.jar:. HelloOpenCVJava
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;-Djava.library.path&lt;/strong&gt; sets the &lt;strong&gt;java.library.path&lt;/strong&gt; property (-D is a flag to set a system property) to inform the JVM where it can locate native libraries. This property is part of the system environment used by Java, in order to find and load native libraries used by an application.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This should be your output:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="highlight"&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="go"&gt;Hello OpenCV 3.2.0!&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="go"&gt;Hello to you too, Java 1.8.0_181!&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The second line may change depending on your version of Java.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We did it! Well, I did it. I hope that you can replicate this in your machine.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To finish, I would like to point out that in the &lt;a class="reference external" href="https://opencv-java-tutorials.readthedocs.io/en/latest/01-installing-opencv-for-java.html#set-up-opencv-for-java-in-eclipse"&gt;OpenCV Java Tutorials Documentation&lt;/a&gt; there's a pretty neat tutorial on how to use OpenCV in an IDE like &lt;a class="reference external" href="https://www.eclipse.org/"&gt;Eclipse&lt;/a&gt;, if you prefer to work in such fashion.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the next chapter of this journey, we will play a little with Mat objects and some images. Stay tuned!&lt;/p&gt;

This post was written to the sound of The Replacement's &lt;a class="reference external" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tim_(album)"&gt;Tim&lt;/a&gt;. You can listen one of the songs &lt;a class="reference external" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cbhQKffugNk"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
</summary><content type="html">&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;andrefellipe.com&lt;/strong&gt; was an idea that I had a long time ago to support my personal projects.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I've developed this personal page using &lt;a class="reference external" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Open-source_software"&gt;open-source&lt;/a&gt; tools, so the very least I can do is thank and mention the projects and the people that made this site possible.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This site is powered by &lt;a class="reference external" href="https://blog.getpelican.com/"&gt;Pelican&lt;/a&gt;, a static site generator written in &lt;a class="reference external" href="https://www.python.org/"&gt;Python&lt;/a&gt;. Thanks to its great documentation and community support, I was able to get everything up and running in a couple of hours. Pelican has a lot of themes developed by its community. The one that you're seeing now is called &lt;a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/alexandrevicenzi/Flex"&gt;Flex&lt;/a&gt; and it was developed by another brazilian, &lt;a class="reference external" href="http://www.alexandrevicenzi.com/"&gt;Alexandre Vicenzi&lt;/a&gt;. I specially love how it looks in a mobile device.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I would also like to thank the second best student of the Federal University of Rio Grande do Norte, &lt;a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/vitorsr"&gt;Vítor Saraiva&lt;/a&gt;. His &lt;a class="reference external" href="https://vitorsr.github.io/"&gt;website&lt;/a&gt; was the source of inspiration to this idea.&lt;/p&gt;
