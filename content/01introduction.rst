:summary: A brief introduction to the site. This post was written to the sound of The Replacement's Tim_. You can listen one of the songs here_.

**andrefellipe.com** was an idea that I had a long time ago to support my personal projects.

I've developed this personal page using open-source_ tools, so the very least I can do is thank and mention the projects and the people that made this site possible.

This site is powered by Pelican_, a static site generator written in Python_. Thanks to its great documentation and community support, I was able to get everything up and running in a couple of hours. Pelican has a lot of themes developed by its community. The one that you're seeing now is called Flex_ and it was developed by another brazilian, `Alexandre Vicenzi`_. I specially love how it looks in a mobile device.

I would also like to thank the second best student of the Federal University of Rio Grande do Norte, `Vítor Saraiva`_. His website_ was the source of inspiration to this idea.
