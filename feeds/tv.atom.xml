&lt;p class="center"&gt;&lt;em&gt;&amp;quot;You should take that act to Vegas. All he needs is a couple of tigers.&amp;quot; - Spider-Man&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Written by:&lt;/strong&gt; John Semper and Mark Hoffmeier.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Family is a fundamental aspect of any iteration of the Spider-Man story and the season premiere of the third season brings this to the forefront. Mary Jane is kidnapped and Spider-Man is looking for her. After a season of sci-fi horror, we encounter the magic world of Doctor Strange, Wong, Baron Mordo, and Dormammu. This was a great change of pace for the series, an episode where Spider-Man's powers were pretty uneffective in combat. Mary Jane that assumes the protagonism here, dealing with her abusive father's past and being brainwashed because of that. It was a great character arc for Mary Jane to overcome by herself the mind control and break free of her past. This allowed her to be a protagonist and not just a damsel in distress. The episode also introduces Doctor Strange in great fashion, telling us about its story with Mordo through quick and productive flashbacks. The character added a lot to the episode, with Spider-Man's reactions to the world of magic being the humorous highlights of the episode.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The Insidious Six&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;img alt="Shot from the first episode of the second season of the Spider-Man 1994 television series." class="align-center" src="images/13-01-S02E01-six.png" /&gt;
&lt;p class="center"&gt;&lt;em&gt;&amp;quot;I go to sleep one lousy day and I wake up in The Twilight Zone.&amp;quot; - Spider-Man&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Written by:&lt;/strong&gt; John Semper and David Lee Miller.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The second season of &lt;strong&gt;Spider-Man: TAS&lt;/strong&gt; starts with one of the most famous Spider-Man stories: The Insidious Six. In this version, Kingpin frees Rhino, Shocker, Doctor Octopus, Mysterio, Scorpion, and Chameleon to take down our hero. Meanwhile, Spider-Man starts to lose its powers in the most unfortunate times. The episode does a good job on playing up the tension between the villains, with Doctor Octopus being reluctant to join forces with them because its own scientific adventures and the conflicts between themselves to see who gets to eliminate Spider-Man. The combination of both storylines - the supergroup villains and Spider-Man without superpowers - creates a positive dynamic, with the hero having to scape on foot and changing it to Peter Parker to avoid disaster. The usage of Aunt May to attract Peter to a trap without its powers leaves us with a tense cliffhanger for the second part. This is a strong start to the season even though it leaves use with a feeling of not much new things happening since Spider-Man is facing previous enemies that we already saw last season.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;New characters such as Michael Morbius and Silvermane are introduced in small bits. Considering how well the series plays with storytelling, I am certain that this is not the last time we will see them this season.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="section" id="battle-of-the-insidious-six"&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Battle of the Insidious Six&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;img alt="Shot from the second episode of the second season of the Spider-Man 1994 television series." class="align-center" src="images/13-02-S02E02-six-battle.png" /&gt;
&lt;p class="center"&gt;&lt;em&gt;&amp;quot;I'll hit them first.&amp;quot; - Kingpin&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Story by&lt;/strong&gt;: John Semper.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Teleplay by&lt;/strong&gt;: Doug Booth.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The second part of the Insidious Six storylines delivers after the good setup in the first part. The most interesting dynamic here is having Spider-Man save Silvermane without knowing anything about the villain and the crossfire between the crime lords while fighting Kingpin's faction. Silvermane is no match for Kingpin when it comes to being a worthy foe for Spider-Man, but the character here serves its purpose, even though why Kingpin should be intimidated by him is not clear. The narrative plays into the &amp;quot;Spider-Man without powers is easy pickins&amp;quot; heavily. The best bits of the episode comes when Spider-Man does not have superpowers and has to rely on Peter's intelligence - and the villains' lack of it - to survive multiple onslaughts. Spider-Man outsmarting six of its main foes at the same time is too good of a premise for anyone to mess it up and the writers deliver once more in this solid start to the season. It's Spider-Man at his best and a delight for us to see.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="section" id="hydro-man"&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Hydro-Man&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;img alt="Shot from the third episode of the second season of the Spider-Man 1994 television series." class="align-center" src="images/13-03-S02E03-hydro-man.png" /&gt;
&lt;p class="center"&gt;&lt;em&gt;&amp;quot;I can give you everything you've ever dreamed of.&amp;quot; - Hydro-Man&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Story by&lt;/strong&gt;: John Semper.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Teleplay by&lt;/strong&gt;: James Krieg.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is the first episode where Spider-Man is only here for the action since the writers decided to give the spotlight for Mary Jane. While our hero is preoccupied with its mutation, Mary Jane receives a unexpected visit from her ex-boyfriend, Morris &amp;quot;Morrie&amp;quot; Bench, who now has superpowers and commits a series of robberies to have money and win her back. The main purpose of the episode is to give more backstory to the Mary Jane character, specially considering that we only know her through the eyes of Peter Parker. While her ex-boyfriend and father storyline is abrupt, I believe that it is because the show until now did not present any story with a similar tone as this one. &lt;strong&gt;Spider-Man: TAS&lt;/strong&gt; focus on Peter Parker, its dramas and its villains with the rest playing it a low-key role in everything. This is the first time the show dedicates so much time to another character and this decision pays off for the future of the series, even though Hydro-Man is too stereotypical here as the bully former boyfriend to be that interesting as a foe. Spider-Man was not even needed to beat him. While not perfect, this was a valid effort to change the scenery for once, with Peter and Mary Jane finally kissing for the first time at the end.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="section" id="the-mutant-agenda"&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The Mutant Agenda&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;img alt="Shot from the fourth episode of the second season of the Spider-Man 1994 television series." class="align-center" src="images/13-04-S02E04-mutant.png" /&gt;
&lt;p class="center"&gt;&lt;em&gt;&amp;quot;But I don't want to be a freak.&amp;quot; - Spider-Man&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Story by&lt;/strong&gt;: John Semper, J. M. DeMatteis and Stevent Grant.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Teleplay by&lt;/strong&gt;: Michael Edens.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now the season raises the stakes. &lt;strong&gt;The Mutant Agenda&lt;/strong&gt; brings the X-Men and allows the show to take its most bold universe expansion so far, crossing over the mutants with a conflicted Spider-Man. While the previous episodes gave glimpses on our hero psyche dealing with its continuous mutation, the fourth episode of the season dives deep on this, with Spider-Man rebuffing the X-Men and isolating himself in searching for a cure. Its Spider-Man at its most serious ever since the Venom storyline and the writers always know how to hit the right points to increase the paranoia, showing the hero's fear of becoming something not human. The X-Men universe blends well with all of this, with the introduction of Herbert Landon, its devious plan and the return of the Hobgoblin sounding natural. The episode introduces and brings back elements of the show with ease, resulting in a crossover fight between Spider-Man and Wolverine that was brewing since the first minute. An excellent episode that pushes the season in a darker direction.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="section" id="mutants-revenge"&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Mutants' Revenge&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;img alt="Shot from the fifth episode of the second season of the Spider-Man 1994 television series." class="align-center" src="images/13-05-S02E05-revenge.png" /&gt;
&lt;p class="center"&gt;&lt;em&gt;&amp;quot;I had to be reminded that when I'm in trouble I'm not alone. I need to turn to my friends.&amp;quot; - Spider-Man&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Story by&lt;/strong&gt;: John Semper and Michael Edens.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Teleplay by&lt;/strong&gt;: Francis Moss and Ted Pedersen.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Spider-Man is a lonely hero. While he has partners that can help him when a dangerous situation arise, he must hide its identity to protect the people close to him. His financial situation is not the best. He has to deal the death of Uncle Ben in his mind. He is not a part of a superhero team. Peter Parker carries the weight of the world in his shoulders and that's why we love him so much. &lt;strong&gt;Mutants' Revenge&lt;/strong&gt; reminds our hero that he can get help from his friends when the going gets tough. In the episode, Spider-Man has to make amends with the X-Men to beat Herbert Landon and the Hobgoblin and finds a possible path to cure its mutation. The way the episode starts with a fight with Wolverine and ends with a green monster while also putting the Hobgoblin in the mix is quite fun and guarantees the action throughout the twenty minutes. Also, the banter with Wolverine goes as well as one can expect. Our heros band together to beat the villain, New York survives once again. Even with this, the final moment is the show in one of its most poignant moments so far: why Spider-Man took so long to go for a friend's help? Why does he have to deal with all that is going on his mind alone? Maybe he has not. That's what this episode is all about. Let's see if it worked in the next one.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="section" id="morbius"&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Morbius&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;img alt="Shot from the sixth episode of the second season of the Spider-Man 1994 television series." class="align-center" src="images/13-06-S02E06-morbius.png" /&gt;
&lt;p class="center"&gt;&lt;em&gt;&amp;quot;I need more plasma.&amp;quot; - Michael Morbius&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Story by&lt;/strong&gt;: John Semper.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Teleplay by&lt;/strong&gt;: Brynne Stephens and Lydia Marano.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Well, it did not. &lt;strong&gt;Morbius&lt;/strong&gt; becomes a vampire-like creature after messing with Spider-Man's blood and the neogenic recombinator. This leaves Spider-Man wondering why everything related to him is poison to his closest people, triggering him to drink the serum that Dr. Crawford made. Then the mutation on his body accelerates instead of curing him. Voilá, we have Peter Parker with four extra arms and my childhood was ruined as soon as I finished this episode. This is a another great installment of the season, transforming Michael Morbius from creepy guy to a tragic figure in love with Felicia Hardy. The amount of tragedies in the second year of the show keeps increasing and it's interesting how the writers can introduce a character like Morbius in a subtle way and a couple of episodes later transform him in one of the series most compelling characters. It's interesting how the good the fight scenes here are, the first with a couple of common robbers almost taking Spider-Man out in a funny bit and the one with Morbius showing our hero not even fighting him, but trying to save him. Considering where we were in the sixth episode of the light-hearted first season, we can see here how much the show has already matured.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="section" id="enter-the-punisher"&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Enter the Punisher&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;img alt="Shot from the seventh episode of the second season of the Spider-Man 1994 television series." class="align-center" src="images/13-07-S02E07-punisher.png" /&gt;
&lt;p class="center"&gt;&lt;em&gt;&amp;quot;Let's just say that you don't own the franchise on weirdness.&amp;quot; - Spider-Man&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Written by&lt;/strong&gt;: John Semper and Carl Potts.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The hunt is on. Punisher shows up to get Spider-Man thinking the six-arms wall crawler kidnapped Morbius. The introduction of the character does seem out of the blue at the start, but enough context is given for us to move forward. This is the episode where Spider-Man mutates into Man-Spider during its fight with Punisher as the cliffhanger. Meanwhile, Morbius is still hungry for plasma. Mary Jane is angry at Peter for not accepting a date with her. A lot of moving parts here. The episode has a great ending, but, overall, it is uneven because the Punisher sounds too much like generical tough guy here. The way the character is presented and its motivation to take out Spider-Man are not convincing, even though the action is good. The episode hits the necessary notes to advance the story and Spider-Man with six arms and as Man-Spider are nice visuals, but after the previous episodes, this was a downgrade.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="section" id="duel-of-the-hunters"&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Duel of the Hunters&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;img alt="Shot from the eight episode of the second season of the Spider-Man 1994 television series." class="align-center" src="images/13-08-S02E08-hunters.png" /&gt;
&lt;p class="center"&gt;&lt;em&gt;&amp;quot;I looked at the devil square in the eyes... And I blinked.&amp;quot; - The Punisher&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Written by&lt;/strong&gt;: John Semper.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Man-Spider storyline reaches a conclusion in explosive fashion, with all the different players involved - Man-Spider, Morbius, Kraven, and Punisher - battling it out in some shape or form during the twenty minutes. It's interesting how the writers combine two characters that were not interesting at first - Punisher and Kraven - and create a positive dynamic with them. This happens because this episode focus on the human side of them instead of the stereotypical characterization that both of them had in previous installments of the series. This is the episode where Spider-Man has almost no dialogue because the of the Man-Spider mutation, so other characters have a better chance to shine. It's one of the best episodes of the season with a powerful message. Monsters sometimes are true victims and we should not give up on people because of our previous experiences.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="section" id="blade-the-vampire-hunter"&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Blade, the Vampire Hunter&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;img alt="Shot from the ninth episode of the second season of the Spider-Man 1994 television series." class="align-center" src="images/13-09-S02E09-blade.png" /&gt;
&lt;p class="center"&gt;&lt;em&gt;&amp;quot;Is there a vampire convention in town?&amp;quot; - Spider-Man&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Written by&lt;/strong&gt;: Stephanie Mathison, Mark Hoffmeier and John Semper.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Another new player shows up in New York: Blade. And he wants Morbius dead. It's interesting how the show introduces Blade in a much better way than the Punisher, giving the character a proper backstory in his first appearance and explaining his hatred for vampires. This propels a interesting episode where he wants to kill Morbius while Spider-Man wants to save him. In the meantime, Morbius learns how to love its powers and wants to transform everyone in vampires, a rehash of the Lizard story that we saw in the first episode of the series. The fight scenes and the mythology involving vampires expands even more of the already rich universe of the show. What makes this episode good, though, is one of Spider-Man recurrent themes: how he still tries to save the world around him while everyone dislikes his guts, as seen here with the police and the people of New York thinking he is the villain. This is always a good plot device and it plays well here. Another important point is how much of the season is composed of Spider-Man teaming with other people to achieve something, as seen here with Blade. Another hunt is on. This time for Morbius.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="section" id="the-immortal-vampire"&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The Immortal Vampire&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;img alt="Shot from the tenth episode of the second season of the Spider-Man 1994 television series." class="align-center" src="images/13-10-S02E10-vampire.png" /&gt;
&lt;p class="center"&gt;&lt;em&gt;&amp;quot;What is running in your veins? Ice water?&amp;quot; - Terri Lee&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Written by&lt;/strong&gt;: John Semper and Meg McLaughlin.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Morbius storyline reaches its conclusion without much conclusion. He kidnaps Aunt May to use as leverage to get Peter to collaborate with him. This triggers an angry Spider-Man that has to rescue her while trying to save Morbius. Meanwhile, Blade and Detective Terri Lee fall in love. This is an episode where a lot of things happen, but they do not have a clear-cut sense of finality, a novel concept for the show. Morbius mutates further into a bat and flies away, Blade goes as well and Peter is relieved since Aunt May is not hurt. Also, Mary Jane finally has enough of him and chooses Harry Osborn. My biggest disappointment with this episode is that it appears to leverage the &lt;a class="reference external" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/If_This_Be_My_Destiny...!"&gt;If This Be My Destiny...!&lt;/a&gt; moment from the comics when it puts Aunt May in danger, but does it so in a half-assed manner, with the classic panel where Spider-Man uses its willpower to scape from danger being used in a Morbius confrontation with almost no dramatic effect. Considering that it is one of the comics most idolized arcs, being used here in such an unconvincing way is what keeps this episode from being great, even though the conflict between Blade, Spider-Man and Morbius creates great action scenes, with Peter desperate to keep the vampire away from his loved ones. Putting Peter's friends and family in the heat of Spider-Man's battles is one of Spider-Man best storytelling devices and &lt;strong&gt;The Immortal Vampire&lt;/strong&gt; uses it for a good effect.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="section" id="tablet-of-time"&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Tablet of Time&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;img alt="Shot from the eleventh episode of the second season of the Spider-Man 1994 television series." class="align-center" src="images/13-11-S02E11-tablet.png" /&gt;
&lt;p class="center"&gt;&lt;em&gt;&amp;quot;Speak for yourself, bugboy. I don't breathe.&amp;quot; - Tombstone&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Written by&lt;/strong&gt;: Mark Hoffmeier, Stan Berkowitz and John Semper.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The one where everybody is kidnapped. The crime lords showdown is back on the spotlight in &lt;strong&gt;Tablet of Time&lt;/strong&gt;. Kingpin and Silvermane are after an ancient artifact known as the Tablet of Time, which has the special power of restore the youth. Dr. Connors and Spider-Man are caught in the middle of this and we have new super robots and new villains - Tombstone and Alisa Silver - to deal with. This episode does a lot of preparation for the final episodes of the season, which the Tablet of Time heavily influences, so the most important parts here are the small character studies that we get a glimpse of. Kingpin has troubles in his marriage since his wife is no longer interested in his line of work. Peter tries to get over Mary Jane and Harry Osborn together and falls right into Alisa Silver's trap. Dr. Connor has to hide away the Lizard once again. While not a groundbreaking or memorable effort, the episode does an appropriate job to setup what comes next on the show.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="section" id="ravages-of-time"&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Ravages of Time&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;img alt="Shot from the twelfth episode of the second season of the Spider-Man 1994 television series." class="align-center" src="images/13-12-S02E12-ravages.png" /&gt;
&lt;p class="center"&gt;&lt;em&gt;&amp;quot;I want to see who is behind the mask.&amp;quot; - Silvermane&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Written by&lt;/strong&gt;: Mark Hoffmeier, Stan Berkowitz and John Semper.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now that's a monkey's paw. Silvermane reaches its goal for youth, but too much of it came through. The best part of &lt;strong&gt;Ravages of Time&lt;/strong&gt; is seeing Silvermane as a baby after all of the hoops to get the Tablet of Time and how Kingpin disposes of it as soon as it acquires for being a reminder of his marriage's problems. The overall sense of waste of time from both villains after the endeavor has a weird humor to it. There were chases, hostage exchanges, scientific experiments and a lot of fighting and nothing was accomplished. Well, at least not for the bad guys, but surprisingly we finished an episode where Spider-Man ends in a place better than where he was at the start, with Dr. Connors being better after receiving the rays from the Tablet of Time. Our hero, though, is still without a cure for its mutation, but at least seeing his friend not suffering is a bright spot in the gloomy atmosphere of the season. This is the weakest storyline of the season - Hydron-Man was a self-contained episode - but we are still advancing towards a finale where Spider-Man still has its unresolved mutation to solve it. While it seems like we are running out of gas in the story and the writers are covering this with crossovers and new characters for the sake of it, the show has earned enough credit for us to have better hope for the final two episodes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="section" id="shriek-of-the-vulture"&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Shriek of the Vulture&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;img alt="Shot from the thirteenth episode of the second season of the Spider-Man 1994 television series." class="align-center" src="images/13-13-S02E13-vulture.png" /&gt;
&lt;p class="center"&gt;&lt;em&gt;&amp;quot;She definitely likes you, pal, so she can't be that smart.&amp;quot; - Peter Parker&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Written by&lt;/strong&gt;: John Semper, Gilles Wheeler and Eyelyn A. R. Gabai.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For the surprise of all, Flash Thompson saves Spider-Man from the Vulture. This episode is an interesting introduction to a member of the rogues gallery that was not yet introduced. The Vulture shares in part the motivations of Silvermane in the previous episodes: have more youth and take out Norman Osborn for the attempted takeover of his company. While the fights and the cliffhanger are fun, the most interesting aspect of the episode is Flash officially going from a bully to a all-american-kind-of-a-buffoon type of hero. His pairing with Debra Whitman works well and the romance between them plays out in natural fashion for a couple of characters that we are not that close in the show. The season goes for its season finale with less tension and darkness than its middle part. Considering that we saw Man-Spider this season, Peter Parker getting old from the hands of the Vulture lacks the drama of the previous storyline. This final stretch of the show's second year is not bad by any means, it just suffers from having to follow-up a strong beginning and middle part of the season.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The Final Nightmare&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;img alt="Shot from the fourteenth episode of the second season of the Spider-Man 1994 television series." class="align-center" src="images/13-14-S02E14-nightmare.png" /&gt;
&lt;p class="center"&gt;&lt;em&gt;&amp;quot;I guess we old folks have to stick together.&amp;quot; - Spider-Man&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="center"&gt;&lt;em&gt;&amp;quot;I had no idea you were a senior citizen.&amp;quot; - Old Lady&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="center"&gt;&lt;em&gt;&amp;quot;It's the job. It ages you.&amp;quot; - Spider-Man&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Written by&lt;/strong&gt;: John Semper and Sandy Fries.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The neogenic nightmare is over. The second season ends in a high note with the Vulture absorbing Spider-Man's mutation and our hero finally being cured after Dr. Connors saves him. But, unfortunately, nothing really good happens with Peter Parker without bad news following it up. Mary Jane mysteriously disappears and this is how the second season ends. Peter can't catch a break. From this last bunch of episodes, this is the best one. Ironically, it's another instance of where the writers combine different villains and characters in a confrontation - Scorpion, Vulture, Lizard and Spider-Man - for multiple reasons, but this one feels more natural thanks to each character having a motivation to use the neogenic recombinator. The irony of the Vulture having the Man-Spider mutation is an interesting twist and another fun monkey's paw moment from the show, but the adventures of an old Peter Parker is my favorite part of the season finale, specially when he has to confront a couple of burglars in an alley. It's a fun episode with a cliffhanger ending that already causes interest for the third season.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That's it. It's been a pleasure to cover the second season of &lt;strong&gt;Spider-Man: TAS&lt;/strong&gt;. The season is darker, works in a much more serious tone and shows a series more comfortable with its storytelling style. The first half is one of the show's best runs and while the final episodes do not have the same excitement, they are solid enough to make this a great season.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now, let's go on to season three.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&amp;quot;Thank you for giving me back my life. What a beautiful day this is gonna be! I feel lucky to be alive. And lucky of being who I am: Spider-Man.&amp;quot; - Spider-Man&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

I decided to rewatch the first season and this is a short review of all episodes. This post was written to the sound of Weezer's &lt;a class="reference external" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Weezer_(Blue_Album)"&gt;Blue Album&lt;/a&gt;. You can listen one of the songs &lt;a class="reference external" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sRfu94lOEPo"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
</summary><content type="html">&lt;p&gt;It's said that your personal experiences make up a small part of what's happened in the world but maybe 80% of how you think the world works*. &lt;strong&gt;Spider-Man: The Animated Series (TAS)&lt;/strong&gt; was the first television show that I religiously followed. I don't even remember my age at the time, but it used to be shown on network TV during weekdays in the morning and I anxiously waited for every episode. Thanks to this series and the fact that I do not follow comic books, my idea of Spider-Man is the version of the story presented here. I'm really excited to write these small bits here, so let's get started...&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;*This also explains why I prefer the movie version that Sam Raimi did instead of the more recent installments, with the exception of the terrible Spider-Man 3, since they are more aligned with this version. Mary Jane Watson &amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt; Gwen Stacy.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Bob Richardson directed all episodes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="section" id="night-of-the-lizard"&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Night of the Lizard&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;img alt="Shot from the first episode of the Spider-Man 1994 television series." class="align-center" src="images/12-01-S01E01-lizard.png" /&gt;
&lt;p class="center"&gt;&lt;em&gt;&amp;quot;What a slimy mess. Why can't I be one of those galaxy hopping superheroes? Why do I end up in the sewers? You don't find the Fantastic Four in the sewer. Or the Avengers. Never do you find the Avengers in the sewers. Or the Defenders. Well, maybe the Hulk.&amp;quot; - Spider-Man&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Written by:&lt;/strong&gt; Gerry Conway, Stan Berkowitz and John Semper.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There's no origin story here. Spider-Man is thrown right into the action to deal with a gigantic reptile that is attacking people in the sewers of New York City. He learns that the creature is his professor and friend Dr. Curt Connors, that used the Neogenic Recombinator to grow back his arm before the equipment turned him on the Lizard.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The pilot is a solid episode. All of the usual suspects, J. Jonah Jameson, Aunt May and Eddie Brock are here and plot elements that will become major parts of the story - like the previously mentioned Neogenic Recombinator - are introduced. This is a good start that shows the difficult financial situation of the Parker family, the bad public perception that Spider-Man has thanks to Jameson and how it's difficult for Peter to balance his life with his responsibilities as a superhero. Everything is packed in twenty minutes on small doses to establish the characters and humor plays a big part, like with the quote above when Spider-Man is in the sewer to fight the Lizard.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="section" id="the-spider-slayer"&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The Spider Slayer&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;img alt="Shot from the second episode of the Spider-Man 1994 television series." class="align-center" src="images/12-02-S01E02-slayer.png" /&gt;
&lt;p class="center"&gt;&lt;em&gt;&amp;quot;I don't stick to walls, see? I can't swing on webs, either. I get airsick.&amp;quot; - Flash Thompson&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Story by&lt;/strong&gt;: John Semper.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Teleplay by&lt;/strong&gt;: Stan Berkowitz.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Considering the target audience, &lt;strong&gt;Spider-Man: TAS&lt;/strong&gt; goes deep in terms of serialized storytelling, small bits of information that don't seem important eventually comes back and the plots get more and more interesting with time. The multi-part episodes are important in this context because it allows the narrative and the characters to be fleshed out in the appropriate pace. This is the first part of the first one that the series made. Since we're early in the series run, we're being slowly introduced to the big players and it's interesting to see how naturally Spider-Man makes enemies. This episode introduces Kingpin, Norman Osborn, Spencer Smythe and Alistair Smythe and their plan to take out the webslinger using robots while Eddie Brock continues his quest for revenge. Also, Felicia Hardy and Flash Tompson show up in a weak subplot where the football player dresses as Spider-Man to scare Peter in Felicia's party.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The episode tries to placate too many moving pieces at the same time. It does not hit home runs in all of them and the Black Widow is never showed as a real threat to Spider-Man. A forgettable effort.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="section" id="return-of-the-spider-slayers"&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Return of the Spider Slayers&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;img alt="Shot from the third episode of the Spider-Man 1994 television series." class="align-center" src="images/12-03-S01E03-return.png" /&gt;
&lt;p class="center"&gt;&lt;em&gt;&amp;quot;Face it, Tiger. You just hit the jackpot.&amp;quot; - Mary Jane Watson&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Story by&lt;/strong&gt;: John Semper.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Teleplay by&lt;/strong&gt;: Mark Hoffmeier.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This was a weird story to tell in a two-part episode. While the previous episode was not a hit, the story of Alistair Smythe aligning himself with the Kingpin is good enough to warrant a continuation, but not exactly right after his father is killed. It would made more sense if the writers did the follow-up later instead of here because this episode was very similar to the first part. Smythe sends robots to attack Spider-Man and everyone involved in &lt;strong&gt;The Spider Slayer&lt;/strong&gt;. Rinse and repeat. There's also a bomb that will detonate in one hour attached to our hero for whatever reason.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Weirdly, the best moment of the series so far comes here: the first appearance of Mary Jane Watson. Just like the comics, she appears at the end to utter her famous line. I guess Peter will change his opinion of blind dates now.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="section" id="doctor-octopus-armed-and-dangerous"&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Doctor Octopus: Armed and Dangerous&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;img alt="Shot from the fourth episode of the Spider-Man 1994 television series." class="align-center" src="images/12-04-S01E04-octopus.png" /&gt;
&lt;p class="center"&gt;&lt;em&gt;&amp;quot;Reminds me of Flash Thompson, all hands.&amp;quot; - Felicia Hardy&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Story by&lt;/strong&gt;: John Semper and Brooks Wachtel.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Teleplay by&lt;/strong&gt;: Brooks Wachtel and Cynthia Harrison.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The best episode of the season so far and we're already seeing the slow introductions to the characters return dividends. Dr. Octopus debuts and his origin story is well presented with the use of flashbacks. The best villains are normally the ones that truly believe that what they're doing is for the greater good and Dr. Octopus is positioned as such here, obsessed with his experiment and kidnapping Felicia Hardy to get revenge on the Hardy family for refusing to support his work and to obtain money to fund it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The script meshes well the protagonist's personal relationship with Felicia alongside his superhero work. Using Peter Parker as the person that delivers the ransom money is a good idea that comes off naturally on screen and the fight scenes between Spider-Man and Dr. Octopus are crafted in a convincing fashion, playing it off the fact that it's two highly-intelligent individuals using their brains to get one over the other. All of the characters are used correctly - even J. Jonah Jameson getting kidnapped because of his mouth makes total sense - and adds up to great twenty minutes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="section" id="the-menace-of-mysterio"&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The Menace of Mysterio&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;img alt="Shot from the fifth episode of the Spider-Man 1994 television series." class="align-center" src="images/12-05-S01E05-mysterio.png" /&gt;
&lt;p class="center"&gt;&lt;em&gt;&amp;quot;I had the power and I didn't use it. I lost my uncle because I ignored my responsibilities. He always used to tell me: with great power comes great responsibility. If I stop being Spider-Man, who else will suffer?&amp;quot; - Peter Parker&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Written by&lt;/strong&gt;: John Semper, Marv Wolfman and Stan Berkowitz.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Mysterio shows up in a plot to frame Spider-Man for a series of robberies while positioning himself as a hero with the help of J. Jonah Jameson. The webslinger has to redeem himself and Peter Parker questions if it's worth it to be Spider-Man since in the whole situation he forgets about his date with Mary Jane.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In this episode we also see one of the main components of the Spider-Man story being brought up for the first time: the murder of Uncle Ben and his importance to the character of Peter Parker. The way the flashbacks and the Mysterio story connect is well done and we can really feel the doubts that Peter has. Is it worthy to sacrifice so much and get so little in return? Maybe not, but running away from the responsibility is a worst option. This dilemma drives the episode and continues the good streak for the series.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="section" id="the-sting-of-the-scorpion"&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The Sting of the Scorpion&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;img alt="Shot from the sixth episode of the Spider-Man 1994 television series." class="align-center" src="images/12-06-S01E06-scorpion.png" /&gt;
&lt;p class="center"&gt;&lt;em&gt;&amp;quot;I knew I should have never left Brooklyn.&amp;quot; - Scorpion&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Written by&lt;/strong&gt;: John Semper, Marv Wolfman and Stan Berkowitz.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;J. Jonah Jameson hires a low-level crook named Marc Gargan with self-steem problems to follow Peter Parker and find out about his relationship with Spider-Man. After his plan fails, he talks to Professor Farley Stillwell to use the Neogenic Recombinator to transform Gargan in a &amp;quot;hero&amp;quot; to take out Spider-Man. Scorpion is born and goes on a rampage all over New York City.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For a cartoon that has only twenty minutes to tell a story, &lt;strong&gt;Spider-Man: TAS&lt;/strong&gt; puts a lot of effort in providing motivations and personalities to every character to makes us sympathize with them. We learn why Jameson hates our hero thanks to a mob hitman with a mask killing his fianceé and pushes him into a more gray area than the position as the series' main villain that he was put previosuly. Even Gargan has certain deep traits for such a simple character, his insecurities associated with the radiation from the Neogenic Recombinator drive him insane and character details like this gives an important spotlight to the supporting players. The episode is a good showing and important because shows that the writers are comfortable and capable to create an universe where there are people outside of Peter that are relevant.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="section" id="kraven-the-hunter"&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Kraven the Hunter&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;img alt="Shot from the seventh episode of the Spider-Man 1994 television series." class="align-center" src="images/12-07-S01E07-kraven.png" /&gt;
&lt;p class="center"&gt;&lt;em&gt;&amp;quot;Welcome to my jungle.&amp;quot; - Kraven&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Story by&lt;/strong&gt;: John Semper and Jan Strnad.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Teleplay by&lt;/strong&gt;: Mark Hoffmeier.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One thing that &lt;strong&gt;Spider-Man: TAS&lt;/strong&gt; did so well in such short amount of time was establish the characters in a convincing manner... until this episode. Spider-Man takes a backseat to a boring love story that serves as the introduction of Kraven the Hunter, a superhuman that was saved by Dr. Mariah Crawford using a drug called the Calypso Serum. He attacks her and kidnaps Robbie.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;All of these three characters are not that well positioned in the series' universe to warrant that much time to their story and Spider-Man is a spectator to all of the action. Sure, he fights crocodiles, but he doesn't drive the narrative. And thanks to the amount of time devoted to the kidnap and the love affair, Peter's subplot where he has to ignore Mary Jane and Felicia Hardy just sounds thrown together at the last minute.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Basically, a safari with a corny villain that ends with Kraven getting an antidote. The weakest installment of the season.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="section" id="the-alien-costume-part-1"&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The Alien Costume, Part 1&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;img alt="Shot from the eight episode of the Spider-Man 1994 television series." class="align-center" src="images/12-08-S01E08-alien-1.png" /&gt;
&lt;p class="center"&gt;&lt;em&gt;&amp;quot;Parker, how on Earth did you get in the middle of Manhattan, hanging upside down in a costume you've never seen before?&amp;quot; - Spider-Man&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Story by&lt;/strong&gt;: Avi Arad and Stan Lee.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Teleplay by&lt;/strong&gt;: Len Wein, Meg McLaughlin, Stan Berkowitz and John Semper.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The three-part episode that brings this series to another level starts here. The Symbiote - and you know who - is one of the most iconic villains of Spider-Man and the narrative here does justice to the character. The best part of the script is that all of the elements that served as pillars of the series so far - Peter's frustation with the lack of recognition he has, J. Jonah Jameson positioning Spider-Man as public enemy number one, Kingpin doing shady deals and Eddie Brock getting screwed - all come together. Also, we get Rhino smashing things and stealing the Promethium X for Kingpin.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This first part has an accelerated pace and gives the necessary substance to each character. It's interesting that it doesn't have subplots or other stories and every major player is gunning for something different inside the same plot.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A great start to this multi-part episode and Peter slow descent into madness - almost killing Rhino - thanks to the Symbiote only gets weirder next.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="section" id="the-alien-costume-part-2"&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The Alien Costume, Part 2&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;img alt="Shot from the ninth episode of the Spider-Man 1994 television series." class="align-center" src="images/12-09-S01E09-alien-2.png" /&gt;
&lt;p class="center"&gt;&lt;em&gt;&amp;quot;You're suppose to be the good guy. You can't do this!&amp;quot; - Shocker&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="center"&gt;&lt;em&gt;&amp;quot;Why not? I have the power.&amp;quot; - Spider-Man&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Story by&lt;/strong&gt;: John Semper and Brynne Stephens.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Teleplay by&lt;/strong&gt;: Brynne Stephens.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Peter's new suit makes him more and more violent while he has to deal with Jameson's bounty. After he learns more about the nature of the suit, he realizes that keeping it may not be the best course of action for his well-being.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While the first part ends with Peter having second thoughts about hurting Rhino, this one ends with the Symbiote assuming the control and almost killing Shocker, our newest addition to the rogues' gallery. Thank goodness, our hero recovers his conscience and reminds himself of the wise words of Uncle Ben. The seamless transformation to insanity of Spider-Man is the main point here and the fits of rage that he throws - including a corny one while chasing Shocker in a church - provides us with great action.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Meanwhile, Jameson has to eat his words and get Spider-Man's help to deal with the kidnap of his son - come to think of it, kidnappings are a common thing in this show - and the writers once again throw him in this uncomfortable position of needing aid.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In his most difficult test so far, Peter has to battle to remember that he's a good person and this story arc continues to prove his fame as the best of the first season.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Oh, and, once again, Eddie Brock gets the short end of the stick. But now he has a new friend to cope with his bad fortunes...&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="section" id="the-alien-costume-part-3"&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The Alien Costume, Part 3&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;img alt="Shot from the tenth episode of the Spider-Man 1994 television series." class="align-center" src="images/12-10-S01E10-alien-3.png" /&gt;
&lt;p class="center"&gt;&lt;em&gt;&amp;quot;You'll see us everywhere, even in your nightmares.&amp;quot; - Venom&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Story by&lt;/strong&gt;: John Semper and Mark Hoffmeier.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Teleplay by&lt;/strong&gt;: Mark Hoffmeier.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The best episode of the first season and the end of a story arc that proves that &lt;strong&gt;Spider-Man: TAS&lt;/strong&gt; is a very mature show for a cartoon. Eddie Brock finally has the means to get revenge on Spider-Man throught the Symbiote. Venom appears and torments Peter's loved ones. The script does a great job at raising the stakes of the confrontation, as Venom knows the webhead's identity and is so consumed by hate that he doesn't think twice before using this knowledge to make Peter suffer. We go through twenty minutes where the villain doesn't stop messing with Peter's head and body, putting the hero in a position where he's outthought and outfought the whole time, even having his mask removed, an opportunity that J. Jonah James can't capitalize on. We jump from one scene to next expecting a breather or a transition to a different scenario, but, nope, there's Venom on top again beating up Spider-Man.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This story arc is impressive because Peter gets to show a lot of different emotions in each episode, from overconfidence to helplessness. Here, it's palpable the fear that he has that Venom can harm Mary Jane and Aunt May and this has him on the brink before being able to use his intelligence to defeat the enemy. All of this is served with great action sequences - the final fight goes on in more than three locations - and a nice ending with him finally having a moment with Mary Jane while they look at the night sky.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="section" id="the-hobgoblin-part-1"&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The Hobgoblin, Part 1&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;img alt="Shot from the eleventh episode of the Spider-Man 1994 television series." class="align-center" src="images/12-11-S01E11-hobgoblin-1.png" /&gt;
&lt;p class="center"&gt;&lt;em&gt;&amp;quot;I want the Kingpin.&amp;quot; - Hobgoblin&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Written by&lt;/strong&gt;: Larry Brody and John Semper.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Introducing the Hobgoblin here is the most questionable decision of the first season considering that it's a completely different approach than the comics. In this two-part episode, that decision may alienate some fans, but it doesn't prevent the story from being fun. The villain appears in a random fashion, but the narrative of a three-way dispute between the Kingpin, Norman Osborn and the Hobgoblin with Spider-Man - and Peter - getting caught in the middle provides us with an episode full of action and double crosses.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is a weird episode because it doesn't care much about providing a backstory to the main villain, trusting that the audience will only recognize the Hobgobling as a power hungry lunatic. The script does a good job at establishing him as a smart figure that puts Osborn and Kingpin against each other with the aim of being the leader of all criminals. The cliffhanger is not the most exciting because we know that the Hobgobling doesn't kill Spider-Man with two bombs and this drags the episode down, but at least we get a closer look at Harry Osborn - that now shares an apartment with Peter - and Kingpin - that uses philanthropy to divert attention from his criminal enterprise.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="section" id="the-hobgoblin-part-2"&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The Hobgoblin, Part 2&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;img alt="Shot from the twelfth episode of the Spider-Man 1994 television series." class="align-center" src="images/12-12-S01E12-hobgoblin-2.png" /&gt;
&lt;p class="center"&gt;&lt;em&gt;&amp;quot;This town has a new Kingpin, Osborn. And it's me!&amp;quot; - Hobgoblin&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Written by&lt;/strong&gt;: Stan Berkowitz.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The enemy of my enemy is my friend is the logic of here. The Hobgoblin takes over Kingpin's criminal enterprise and pays the price soon after. Following the uneasy alliances of the last episode, everything is shuffled here: now Osborn and Kingpin have to take out the Hobgoblin. They use Spider-Man to do their bidding and the irony of the webhead helping them without knowing that Kingpin is pulling his strings is an awesome achievement of the script.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While nothing is as good as &lt;strong&gt;The Alien Costume&lt;/strong&gt; arc, the Hobgoblin's arc has its strong moments, specially the creative fight scene where Spider-Man doesn't have buildings to swing his web to run away from the villain's attacks, having to use his feet and quick thinking.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="section" id="day-of-the-chameleon"&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Day of the Chameleon&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;img alt="Shot from the thirteenth episode of the Spider-Man 1994 television series." class="align-center" src="images/12-13-S01E13-chameleon.png" /&gt;
&lt;p class="center"&gt;&lt;em&gt;&amp;quot;I took a gamble that Peter Parker was the luckiest man on Earth.&amp;quot; - Chameleon&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Written by&lt;/strong&gt;: John Semper.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The season finale brings Chameleon, an international spy, to ruin a peace proposal. SHIELD enlists J. Jonah Jameson to catch him and avoid the murder of two diplomats while Spider-Man sticks his nose in the middle of everything because that's what he does.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Chameleon is a good villain because while he is not presented as a mortal threat to our hero, his gimmick is at least the source of funny material. The rule of this episode is to finish the season in a high note and even when Peter gets caught in a bad situation - Chameleon kisses Mary Jane while disguising as him - the purpose is only comedy. The script is smart and doesn't do a banana peel ending to the story since Chameleon actually gets caught because of two mistakes that he could not avoid.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A smart bad guy, an intelligent good guy, Nick Fury congratulating him and Peter in hot water with Mary Jane... that's quite a good day for our friendly neighborhood Spider-Man.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And that's it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is a light-hearted first season compared to the more serious tone of the rest of the series. &lt;strong&gt;Spider-Man: TAS&lt;/strong&gt; barely missed a step and delivered the goods, specially with the Venom arc. The rogues' gallery was well introduced and the Hobgoblin, Dr. Octopus and Scorpion had great appearances. Kraven and the Spider Slayers were lowlights of the season, but the overall experience was a great reimagination of this brilliant universe.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
